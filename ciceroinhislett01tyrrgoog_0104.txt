xcvi CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

to the eleventh century, and consiste of twenty-five
quaternione. It contains the Epp. ad Fam. ixexvi„
together with the letter to Augustus Octavianus, the De
petitione cone„ the Laelius, cato Maior, De Officiis, the
Philippics, the VerrineS, the speeches in Sallustium, pro
Milone, de Imperio Pompeii, pro Marce110, pro Ligari0, and
pro Deiotaro 3 together with some other authors, as Ful-

ad Fam. hes a separate index. The letters and part of
the speeehes are corrected by two hands throughout.

H⁸ is independent of M 3 as is sufficiently shown—

one letter in M, but are given separately in 11⁸.

in two columns. It belongs to the twelfth century. It
contains from the beginning of Fam. i. 1 to the words
puto etiam si ullam spem, Fam. viii. 9, 3. It is cer-
tainly independent of M. It wants from Fam. i. 9, 20,
non solum praesenti, to Fam. ii. 1, diqnitate ee consecutus.
There is no distinction made between the first and second
books. Accordingly book iii. is in Hb called book ii„
book iv. is book iii„ and so on. There are no separate
indices to each book of the letters, as in H⁸.
