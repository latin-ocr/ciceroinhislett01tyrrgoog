INTRODUOEION xci

ful or exact as Cicero himself. Subjoined are examples
of· words and phrases not to be found in Cicero, but
occul-ring in the letters of his correspondente21—

(1) In the undoubtedly genuine letter of Brutus,
Fam. xi. 2, we find, in g 2, aliud libertate, ‘different
from (other than) liberty? This abl. of comparison is
found only in Varro, R. R. iii. 16, 23, aliud melle ,⁰ Hor.
Sat. ii. 3, 208, aliae verim id. Ep. i. 16, 20, alium
sapiente ,· and in Phaedrus and Apuleius.

Ibid. factdtatem decipiendi nos ,· αἱ epatium confimc-
audi sese, Asinius Pollio, Fam. x. 33, 5.

(2) Balbus, Att. viii. 15a, 1, writes diqnissimam tuae
virtutis ,· for diywus with gen. (which is un-Giceronian)
cf. PL Ten. v. 2, 29. ‘

(3) Bithynicus, Fam. vi. 16, uses intermoriturum ,-
no part of intermori, but intermortuus is found in Cicero.

(4) Galba, Fam. ix. 30, 3, 4, has dexterius and
sinisterius. ι

(5) Plancus, Fam. x. 8, 4, has diffiteri,· Fam. x. 15,
4, praecoque-scere ,· Fam. x. 18, 3, sollicitiorem ,· and in
Fam. x. 11, l‚ut . . . me civem diquum . . . praestem,·
whereas Cicero uses se praestare with a predicative
accusative only in the case of a pronoun or adjective.

(6) Quintus Cicero, Fam. xvi. 27, 2, has dissuaviabor.

(7) Servius Sulpicius, Fam. iv. 5, 2, has existimare
with genitive of price 3 Fam. iv. 5, 5, perfunctum esse.

¹ I do not take into account the letter of Quintus, de petitione
consulatue, as being really rather a rhetorical treatise than a letter 3
nor the Brutine coi-respondeum, as involving a still unsettled

ἱ question.
