ο CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

in, and carefully regarded in the arrangement of the
text. - Just as Henri Estienne (the famous Stephanus)
vitiated the criticism of Euripides by recommending his
own usually excellent conjectures by the authority of

Frenchman, Simeon Du Boe, a native of Limoges, born
1535, imposed on the most learned men of three

readers the source in his edition published at Limoges,
1580, but he gives the following rather vagus details :—

detection for nearly three hundred years, and it was not
until the year 1855 that Maurice Haupt discovered that
no such mss. as the Deam-tatus (Y) and Crueellinus (X)
