'ltallliz trzgtglafl· Gggrgise, to ee liis mind arngdlsed, and to avoid
constipation ; as this is me ical advice, Cicero clothes it in
Greek in the form of a. prescription, πέψιν, dacor-lav, περίπατον
σύμμετρον, τέρψιν, εὐλυσίαν κοιλίας. [The physicians and the
writers on medicine were Greeks almost to a man.]

meis ad te rationibus, The order of the words is strange,
but hyperbaton is a feature in the style of these letters: cf. Att.
i. 14, 1, ut huic mlx ramulae epistolae tempus habuerim ; Fam.
iii. 9, 3, tuis incredibiliter studiis . . . delector ; cf. also Att.
iv. 17, 3, 4; Fam. iii. 7, 4. [The cause here is the great
tendency Cic. has to bring pronouns as near together as he
can.]

Catilinam . . . defendere. Catiline was now on his trial for
his malversation in Africa, and Cicero seems to have entertained
the design of defending him. This is put forward by the tra-
ducere of Cicero as a proof that he was at this time making
advances towards the popular rty. But Catiline was not at
this time re rded as the lea er of the popular party, and if
Cicero had efended him he would have been doing nothing at
all politicall significant. See Or. pro Caelio, 14, in which
Cicero says t at at one time he did not suspect Catilina. It
would have been quite natural that he should now defend
Catiline as he afterwards defended Fonteius. His way to dis-
tinction depended on his achieving a great position at the
Bar, and it would have been ver adverse to his ultimate
chance of the consulship if he ha now refused to undertake
important cases, The time came when Cicero could pick and
choose his briefe, but it had not yet arrived. As a matter of
fact, Cicero did not defend Catilina. This is rendered clear by
the fact that in the Oratio in Toga Candida Cicero reproaches his
other com titor Antonius with some slight services which he
had done {eim in his candidature for the raetorship. Is it
then credible that if Cicero had really de ended Catiline he
would have failed to twit him with the fact? And, if he had
defended Catiline, could he have said in this speech, ‘ Miserable
man, not to see that by that verdict you were not acquitted‚
but reserved for a more serious unishment ' ’.ἱ But if Cicero had
defended Catiline his act wou d have been neither immoral nor
unprofessional.
