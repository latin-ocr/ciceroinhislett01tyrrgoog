20. mi Attice. This 18 1110 first time that Cicero addresses
his friend as Attice ,· therefore the heading Cicero Attico Sal„
usually prefixed to the letters to Atticus throughout, is 001-
tainly not genuine.

urse himself for the expenses of his candidaturc. 010. (Fam.

right, though the correction of a to de before civitatibus would
make the passage easier. But it would be hard to account for
the corruption. If a civitatibus is what Cicero wrote, the
