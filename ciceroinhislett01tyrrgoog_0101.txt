INTBODUOTION xciii

which are certainly genuine, should twice hit on an un·
Ciceronian usage, and that in one of these violatione
there should be associated with him another of Cicero's
correspondents, Asinius Pollio. Again, Cicero, we may
suppose, must have had some reason for not using digmus
with the genitive, or existimare with the genitive of
price3 this reason must have been unknown to Balbus
and Sulpicius, or else deliberately reJected by them.
Finally, we may be surprised not to find in the seven
hundred and fifty letters of Cicero more words ἅπαξ
εἰρημένα in classical Latin, when in the two letters of
Quintus 'Cicero we find one, and in the twelve letters of
Plancus three.

The conclusion seems to be that the correspondents of
Cicero are even less careful than he is to avoid the vul-
garism‘s and laxities which beset the speech of daily life.
Α confirmation of this is to be found in their respective
usage (pointed out by Lieberkiihn) with regard to a
phrase which occurs repeatedly in the letters. Cicero
always (except in two places, Att. v. 10, 1 3 viii. 14, 1)
writes mihi creda On the other hand, crede mihi is the
phrase of Brutus, Fam. xi. 26 3 Cassius, Fam. xii. 12, 4 3
Caelius, Fam. viii. 17, 1. According to Bockel (Epis-
tulae selectae, 8th ed„ p. 323) crede mihi is a vulgar-ism,
or, at least, belongs especially to familiar speech. Such
distinctions, however, are perhaps too fine-drawn to find
favour out of Germany. Among such may be classed the
acute observation of Wolfflin (Philol. xxxiv. p. 134) that,
while in his earliest speeches and letters Cicero greatly
prefers abs te, he gradually seems to show a growing
