INTRODUCTION lxxxi

Brutus, and wife of Lepidus. Neither Brutus nor
Lepidus took any notiee of the matter, and Brutus still
kept up his intimacy with Vedius. This' 1s Oicero' s way
of telling it—in his (sc. rebus Vedii) inventae eunt
quinque imayunculac matronarum, in quibus una sororis
amici tui hominis Bruti qui hoc utatur, et uaeoris illius
Lepidi qui ’haec tam myleyeuter ferat,‘ among which was
a model of the sister of your friend Brutus (a brute part,¹
indeed, to ke'ep up the fellow’s acquaintance), and wife
of Lepidus (sauny, indeed, to take the matter so coolly).’
Here, but for the subjunctive, there would be no play on
the words Bmctm and Lepidm.

(2) The phrase ita . . . ut is very delicately em-
ployed in the letters, and it is often hard to find an exact
equivalent in English for this Latin idiom. For instance,
Att. i. 1, l, ita neyant mdyo ut mihi se debere dicant,
‘ their refusal generally takes the form of a statement
that they are pledged to me ’3 Att. i. 19, 8, ita tamen
hie novis amicitiis implicati summ ut vafer ille Siculus
insusurret cantilenam illam suam, ‘ involved as I am in
many new acquaintanceships, yet 1 do not let them pre-
vent me from having constantly in my ears the refrain of
the astute Sicilian’; Q„ Fr. i. 1, 10, quem ecio ita labo-
rare de existimatione sua ‘ut . . . etiam de nostra laboret,
‘ in whom I know a keen regard for ln‘s own reputation
is yet compatible with as keen a regard for ours ’3 Att.
ii. 4, 7, πιαφιί aestimo . . . fmwtum palaestrae Pala-

¹ cf. Hamiet, iii. 2: Polonius. I did enact Julius Caesar. 1
was killed in the Capitol. Brutus killed me. Ham. It was a
brute part of him to kin so capital a calf there.
