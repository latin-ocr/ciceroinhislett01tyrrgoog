Because the 0οᾱ old rule
Sufficeth them, the simp e 1811,
That they should take whethave the power,
And they should keep who 0811.

The quotation which Cicero uses to convey this sentiment is
stom Ennius, Annales, 275 (Vahlen). The whole fragment

which describes the uselessness of the arts of peace in time of
war runs thus-—

Pellitur 0 medio sapientia, vi eritur res,

- Spernitur orator bonus, horri us miles amatur,
Haud doctis dictis certantes sed maledictis
Miscent inter sese inimicitiam agitantes.

Non ex iure manum consertum sed magi· fen-o
Rem repetunt regnumque petunt, vadunt solida vi.

In this fragment sapientia seems to be used in the sense which
it often bears in the letters to Trebatius, ‘ the art of the juris-
consult! Observe the unelided -am in inimicitiam. The 0011-
struction of mamam conseo-cumi is strange. ommam is the
supine of conserere, depending on ewnt or vocant, taken out of
“ repetunt, and governing manwm. Ex iure means ‘ in accord·
81100 with legal rights of a citizen.’ Manum conserere has 8
double sense—(1) ‘ to make 8 legal claim to roperty,’ (2) ‘ to
