numae, brapmhora, delficae, subsellia, eto), where the furni-
ture of a house is in a way inventoried, we find mention of three
kinds of tables —mmae, itt-apezophora, and delphicae. Now
mamae are large dining-tables, and delphicae are round tables on
three legs: for one exam le, among many, to rove this, take

(iv. 311) ε ἐν ταλατίῳ ’γὰρ τῳ ἐπὶ Ρώμης, ἔνθα συνέβαινε στιβάδας
τὰς βασιλέως εἶναι, τρίτους ἐκ παλαιοῦ εἱστήκει, ἐφ’ οῦ δὴ τὰς κύλικας

Tarningto trapezophora, its derivation is ‘ table-bearet ’ 3 but
that it oan be also used for a ⁶ table ’ is plain from Pollux,
Onomastic. x. 69, ἔξεστι δὲ τὴν τράπεζαν ἐφ’ ἤ τὰ ἐκπώματα

βούλοιτο φιλοτιμεῖσθαι πρὸς τὴν καινότητα τῆς χρήσεως (‘ to be am·
bitious of the eleganee of the new style ’) τραπεζοφόρον, and in-
deed also from the Digest (l.c.), sinee it is quite impossible that
Paulus should have omitted sueh a eommon article of furniture
as the abacue, which he has plainly eomprehended here under
the term trapezophora, for in striotness trapezophoron 18 the

κύκλον τῆς τραπέζης. In its sense of ‘table’ abactas was sup·
ported sometimes by four legs, sometimes by one (see Pollux,
Ζ.ο.); the legs were usuall of marble or ivo (J uv. 11, 122),
but sometimes of bronze ( arquardt, Le.) e fashioning of
these legs was a distinet braneh of sculpture: of. Juvenal,

The Chiron was the τραπεζοφόρος. Examples are also found in
museums of sphinxes and griffins. The δελφινὶς τράπεζα of
Lucian, Lexiph. 7, probably had a dolphin for the τραπεζοφόρον.
