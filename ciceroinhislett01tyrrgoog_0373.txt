cornua ventis. It reminds us of the Euripidem ἐς κέρας θυμού-
μενοι (Bacch. 743), and may be rendered—

When he had wreaked the tury of his horns
On the void air in vain.

Cic. then goes on to explain the sense in which he quotes the
verse, which is, ‘ after he had uttered many idle curses, which,’
he adds, ‘ Ι hope will come home to roost, as the proverb has
it.’ Gwm dixisset, the reading of the msa, is quite ri ht and
quite indigpensable. Edd. make a great mistake in c nging
it to ewm ixisse.

en. I have restored this word, which is demanded by the
construction. Btr. inserts o, but en would have fallen out
more easily before m‘. So in Att. xiv. 5, 2, I would restore
en meam stultitiam. His placableness of disposition was
shown by reoelling the furious letter which he had written
to Dionysius. [It must be allowed, Ι think, that Cic. used
the accus. of exclamation without either en or 0. The exit. are
too numerous to be all due to the chances of mss, Ι would
therefore not alter either this passage or Att. xiv. 5, 2, or Att.
xv. 3, 2, praeclaros XIV. crdivws Ι]

a pedibus meis, ‘ from personal attendance on myself, '
which shows that Cic. had even to submit to personal incon·
venience in recalling his angi-y missive. Body·servants in
close attendance on their masters were said a pedibus stare.
We have a leyatorwm pedibus abduxerit in Deiot. 2, and circum
pedes in 2 Verr. i. 92. Victorius changed meis to meum, and
supposed servum a pedibus to mean ‘ a valet,' but this designa·
tion of the duties of slaves by the prep. a is post-Ciceronian.
[Are there exx. of a pedibus stam? Suet. has ad pedes stan-e,
ἕῗῖἐῗέἶὲθῆῗέοι, ἱέἓωῃξξὲθέθῗᾶεἶιῖᾞξὲὢέῗιῗιοῖἷο·ῑὲἒᾜῗ
ably pass to a pedibus,gthe phrase servus α pedibus being such a
famihar one later on.]

2. de re Corfiniensi. Ι have inserted de re on the suggestion
of Mr. Purser, who points out that it probably got out of its
place and gave rise to the corrupt reading des Μ’. Curio. The
regular prep. after eoespectatio is de ; cf. eat-speciatim de Pompeio,
Att. iii. 14, 1. Eoespectatio Corfiniensi-3 for ‘ anticipatione of
what is going on in Corfinium ' seems stran e Latin ; for some
account of how things were going on at Cor nium see Att. viii.
3, 7. [I suppose it is the fact that exspectatio is a word describ-
