sold to M. Le idus3 (3) at Formiae3 (4) at Pompeii3 (5) Cumae3
(6) Puteoli; 7) Astura. He had also several deversoria, or

laces where he could put u for a night, aq. at Tarracina,

inuessa, Cales, Anagnia. uoh ‘ lodges ' were indis nsable
for distinguished persons who would travel in a style efitting
their rank at a time when there was hardly anythin like hotel
accommodatiori. He also had a house in Rome, on t e Carinae,
which he made over to his brother Quintus, when he himself
after his consulate bought the magnificent house of M. Crassus,
on the Palatino, for a sum of nearl 3330, 000. This was the
house which was destroyed by Clo ius in the year 697 (57),
and for the restoration of which a money ant was made by
the senate after Cicero's return from exile, wffirich he complained
of as insufficient for the purpose.

LETTER 11. (Am, 1. 7)

Apud matrem. ‘ Your mother and her household are
getting on very well.’

curaturum, ‘ will see to the payment of)

HS xxod. This very sum, 20,400 sesterces (217328s.), is
expressed by quite different symbols in Att. i. 8. It should not
mmmmm ...2:2..
or not, according to the context. Thus in an English letter if
we met the expression ‘ 1 gave 100 for a horse,’ we should guess
it meant 5:100, not 100 shillings ; but if we found ‘ Ι gave
1000 for a horse,’ we might not feel quite sure whether the word
written was house or horse. This being se, I follow the practice
of those editors who do not su ply in the text the horizontal
stroke (which is not found in t e mss.), but leave the symbol
as it is found in the mss„ adding an explanation, if requisito,
in the footnotes. [cf. the curicus story about Tiberius in Suet.
Galb. 5 ε sestertium quinqevzties cum praecipuwm inter legatarios
habuisset, qwia notata ‘non msoeipm erat samma, herede
Tiberio ad quinqenta revocando, ne luteo quidem acepit]

conficere, ‘ secure!
