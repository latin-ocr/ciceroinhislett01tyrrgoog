lii CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

their base treachery in secking to prejudicc him with
Caesar. ·

Τ. Pomponius Atticus, who stood to Cicero in the
relation which Sir Horace Manu occupied to the Cicero
of English letter-writing, Horace Walpole, is not a
pleasing person. His persistent neutrality in politics 1
was a course which, though nowise reprehensible in our
own times, must have been very much condemned in the
days of Cicero. Yet hc seems to have escaped to a great
extent from adverse criticism3 and, though connected
with the unfortunate Sulpicius, he succeeded in living
uninjured by Cinnan or Sullam and in affording pecuniary
assistance to Marius in his flight. He was intimate
with the best Romans, from Sulla to Augustus3 he was
on good terms with both Caesar and Pompeius; he had
the warm friendship of Brutus, Hortensius, and Cicer0,
and excited the enthusiastic admiration of Cornelius
Nepos, the friend of Catullus. This he accomplished
partly by availing himself of the shelter of his philosophic
opinions. The Epicurean was speculatively bound to
prefer the life of thought to the life of action. But he
could not have preserved his complete tranquillity had he
not early migrated to Athens, and there remained for
about twenty years. In Athens we find him leading the
life of a cultured gentleman, a recognised patron of
literature and the fine arts, and recommending himself to
his adopted fellow-citizens by gifts of corn grown, no

¹ As regards actions at least. Hc had, it appears, the strongest
political feelings. We are told that Atticus exclaimed perii-sse
causam si (Caesar) sunere elatus esset.
