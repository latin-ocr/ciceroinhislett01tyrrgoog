’ xcii CICERO IN HIS LETTERS ἢ

(8) The language of Caelius is marked throughout by
peculiarities, in most cases taking the form of archaism
and approximation to the language of the stage. The
following may be quoted here: ——

(a) Colloquial and redolent of the comic stage: quod
illorum capiti eit, Fam. viii. 1, 5, cf. Ter. Phorm. iii. 2,
63 nunquam=nou, 14, 1, cf. Donatus on Ter. Andr. ii.
4, 7 ; Ῑήρονσ ftiyescimus, 6, 4, cf. curriculo transcurre,
Plaut. Mil. ii. 6, 43, ornatu ornatus, iv. 3, 41 3 uisi si,
15, 13 hui, 15, 23 quam with the positive of the adj„
as quam clementer, 8, 2.

(b) Rare words and usages: susurratores, 1, 4 3 sul>-

2317,13quoiforcui, 2, 13 8,23 12,2;-ilciforiuie‚
15, 2; istoc for istuc, 4, 13 rusus for rursus, 8, 3 3
