so in Att. viii. 3, 7, reverti Formias, though he had not yet
left Gales, but would have returned to Formiae before Atticus
received the letter. ‘So misi, in Att. iv. 2, 5, means ‘ I send

For serviendum cf. Att. v. 11, 5. Tullia was married to
Calpurnius Piso, of whom Cicero always speaks in the highest
terme, especially in Brut. 272. Piso refused to go to Pontus
and Bithynia as quaestor, so that he might attend to the affairs
of his exiled father-in-law in Rome, and incurred on Cicero's
behalf the enmity of his kinsman, the consul (Post Red. in
Seu. 38). He died robably about the time of Cicero’s restora-
tion. Cicero says est. 68), Piso ille ρεπεν ‘meus cui fructum
pietatis suae mque eae me ‘neque a pop. Romano serre licuit.
Tullia’s dowry'seems not to have been yet aid, and from this
Cicero apprehende danger ‘ to her married appiness and good
name.’
