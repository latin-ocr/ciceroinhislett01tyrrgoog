xxxii CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

the outbreak of the civil war may thus be summed up :—
What Cicero hoped for was an arrangement (compositio,
concordia). Anything should be surrendered rather than
have war.1 War will bring the tyrannis. Therefore Cicero
hesitates, and does not openly j0in Pompeius, whose
flight from Italy he condemns, while he despises the in-
capacity, dilatoriness, oowardioe (almost) of his supportem.
Moreover, peace is what Cicero most desires: now peace
Pompeius will not have ε ² he even fears 112.ss Yet Cicero
hopes he will be able to influence Pompeius.4 On the
other hand, Caesar is very powerful, very active, and
very conciliatory. But Cicero says ‘ he is running a-
muck ' (ruit) 3 he is perditus ,· he is a tyrannus ,· his acts
are furor, scelus. If war is unavoidable, Cicero must
join Pompeius3 not to do so would be inglorious, dis-
honourable, ungrateful. Yet, again, to think of the
recklessness of the Optimates and the violence which
would follow their victory. No matter: Pompeius alone
moves Cicero ; the acts of him and his side have been a
tissue of blunders: but his side is the right one. ‘ Mihi
σκάφος,’ he writes, Att. vii. 3, 5, ‘unum erit quod a
Pompeio gubernabitur!

1 qu ie sum qui illi concedi putem utilius esse quod postulat,
quam siqua consona—Ast. vii. 5, 5.

² Quod quaeri-s ecquae epea pamfioationis sit quantum 0oe Pom·
peii multo et accwrato sermone perspexi, ne voluntas quidem est.—
Att. vii. 8, 4.

⁸ Non modo nem expetere paoem istam sed etiam timere vim
esa—Att. vii. 8, 5.

⁴ Ipsum Pompeium septu-atim ad concordiam hortabere-Att-
vii. 3, 5.
