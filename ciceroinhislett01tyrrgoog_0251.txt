4. De Acutiliano negotio· See Att. i. 4, 1, and Att. i.
8, 1. As the latter letter was written in 687 (no, 67), tho
business must have been unfinished at the end of two years.
well might Cicero say accidit ut maritimae nihil cama esset, ⁴ it
so happened that there was no need of any great haste!

tuo digressu, ‘ after parting from you ' ; tuo is used
instead of the objective gen. 3 cf. odio tuo, desederit» tuo,
‘hatred of you, regret for you,' Ter. Phorm. v. 8, 27 ; Heaut.
ii. 3, 66. So Fam. x. 24, 1, tua observantia, ‘attention to you.'
In Att. ii. 13, 1, tuam epsstolam means ‘a letter ιο you.'

confeceram. Perha this may be best taken here as the
epistolem] plupersect. 1 not writing a letter he would have
used the imperf. conjiciebam, ‘I meant to finish the business,
but‚’ etc. In a letter conficiebam would mean, ‘I am finishing,’
so he is forced to use the pluperfi, just as in Att. v. 14, ano
iter cmfflciebaanus prabum-alanta via. Dederoem ΕΡῙιεεο pridie.
Has dedi Trallibus· See Roby, ἕ 1468. [Cic. seems to me to

apology for not aving written earlier to Att.]

duxi. One would at first sight expect duxissem, which
Malas ina conjectured, and Bosius pretended to have found in
one ο his fabricated mss. But duxi is uite right. Cicero is
defending himself from the charge that e neglected to write,
so as to escape the trouble of it. ‘ Seeing that Ῑ endured to
listen to Acutilius for several days, Ι did not think it a great
task to write you an account of his complaints, when Ι made
so li ht of listening to them, which was somewhat a bore. ’ We
shouffd rather have expected a word enhancing the meaning of
odiosmn than a proposition ,which ,mitigatos as sub. Cicero
affects words compounded of sub in this sense.

unas. Una-3 litteras, ‘ one letter,' there bein no ambiguity 3
but dm litterae would be ‘ two letters of the phabet.’ Tw0,
three letters (epistles), etc. , must be expressed by the distributive

numerals bime, mnae, etc.

6. Quod scribis, etc. ‘ You write that even if somebody
is a little offended with you, my part ought to be to bri about
a better fec ⁰ z Ι see what you mean, and 1 did m est to
that end 3 but e feels the matter very deeply. Ῑ di not fail
to say all that was ncedful about our case, but how far Ι
