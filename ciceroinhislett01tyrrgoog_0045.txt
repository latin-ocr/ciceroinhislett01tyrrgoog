evidence that his father left him any great fortune?
The chief source, no doubt, was his practice at the Bar,
especially as the advocate of foreign States and Kings.
For though the Oineian Law ¹ forbade the feeing of
advocates, yet there is abundant evidence that the thank-
fulness of successfullydefended cliente generally took a
substantial form. We may perhaps infer from Att. i.
20, 7, that the gratitude of L. Papirius Paetus shewed'
itself in the appropriate present of his library, and the
tone of this passage leads us to surmise that the Lex
Oincia de Muneribus, now nearly 150 years old, had to
a great extent become obsoleto.² Cicero, then, who de-
voted himself to the Bar at the early age of 25, must
have made a considerable income by his profession. For
there seems to have been but one other source of income
to him—legacies left by grateful clients or admiring
friends, Plutarch tells us that early in life he was be-
queathed a sum of about 33000, but his receipts under
this head are probably much exaggerated.⁸ For instance,

we are asked to believe that in 59 the Stoic Diodotus, .

¹ This law was really an aristocratia measure. It shut the
career of an advocate to all who did not possess some fortune.
It denied the necessities of life to the advocate, while it gave him
the luxuries, which came in the form of handsome presente from
wealthy cliente. The Bar then, as a political career, until very
recent times, was the privilege of the well-to-do.

² It is possible, indeed, that the remark here may be merely
playful‚ as there is no evidence that cicero* ever acted as advocate
for Papirius Paetus. But, besides this passage, there is abundant
proof that this law was practically a dead letter.

⁸ Cicero boasts (PhiL ii. 40) that he had received in bequests
above 3170,000‚ but this is probably a rhetorical hyperbole.
