Boot, and others read discessit on the ground that 010010 wo d
not have been so unfeeling as to announce his father's death in
such curt terms. Boot urges that 110 is deeply moved at 1110
1100111 of his slave, Sositheus (Att. i. 12, 4)= we ma also notice
Cicero's almost exa rated expressions of grief, r Lentulus
(Att. iv. 6). But ἔξεο read disce-3822, we must also read pater
noster discessit, ‘my father left‚’ instead of pater nobis discessit,
the ethical dative implying serious loss 1ο oneself3 unless,
indeed, we make a further change, and read a nobie discessit,
and even then it is not probable that Cicero would write ‘my
father has left ' without mentioning whither he went, or why
he thought the fact worth recording. But the chief ar ent
against decessit is the alleged evidence of Asconius that ‘cero‘s
father did not die till the year 690 (no, 64). The passage of
Asc. is, however, highly suspicions. In enumerating the com-
petitore of Cicero for the consulship, Asc. in his commentary
on the Oratio in Toga Candida writes :-‘ Duos tricies P. Sulp.
Galbam, L. Sergium Catilinam; 110111101- 111οᾓ100, ex quibus
duos nobiles, 0. Antonium, L. assium Longinum3 duo qui
tantum non primi ex suis familiis magistratum adepti erant,
Q. Cornificium et 0. Licinium Sacerdotem. Solus Cicero ex
competitoribus equestri erat loco natus, atque in petitione patrem
amisit! Could anything be more abrupt or irrelevant than the
words in italics‘3 1 believe the passage of Asc. is unsonnd.
Very possibly Asc. wrote omisit, as Mr. Han-ison, of St. J ohn’s
0011080, Cambridge, has suggested to me. It may have been
customary in the professio 1ο give the father’s name with one's
own. Cicero may have excited comment by omitting this
