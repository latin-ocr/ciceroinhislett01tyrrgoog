the certainty of a demonstration when Mommsen found
that a ms. deposited in Paris contained the rough drast of
Bosius' notes for the last seven books of the Epp. ad
Att- On comparing these with the published commen-

and another in the published commentary. In each case
he recommended his own conjecture by the authority of
