certainly does not bear its ordinary meaning here ; 1t is either
a juridical term, or it is unsound, and must give place to some
conjecture such as intectus. [May not medus come from
imeae? This word is ve common (cf. inaeqmnentmn) and
Lucr. i. 404 has the particip e (which no doubt occurs elsewhere).
The jest lies partly in telum .· ‘ wisdom is the best offensive
