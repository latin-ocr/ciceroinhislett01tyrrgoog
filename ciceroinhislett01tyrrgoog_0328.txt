LETTER XXIX. (ATT- V. 12)

1. Negotium, ‘A iece of business,’ like Greek ἔργον 2
sometimes it is used 'ke Greek χρῆμα, as Teucris is called
ἰεὲῒιῖηζι ὅθρὲεζαῖῗ, l‘la {low coach,’ Att. i. 12, 1 z cf. also Att. v.

Zostera. Zoster was a promontory of Attica, with a town
and harbour, now C. Lombarda.

θεοεΚέω, the accus. of Κέως, according to the so·cal.led

The fragment is quoted by Plut. de Superstit. c. 8, and by
Theophr. de Signis Tempest. 3, 8. So the heights on the pro·
montory of Gyras afforded a recognised‚ almost proverbial,
