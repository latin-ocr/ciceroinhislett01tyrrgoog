ἁσμένιστον, which is usually, but wrongly, taken as a superla-
tive of ἅσμενος ; for in the first lace the word could then only
mean ‘ very glad‚’ not ‘ very we come,' which latter sense the
&euge demands ; and secondly, the superl. of ἄσμενος used by

means, as it ought to mean, ‘most gladly.'

temperatius. This, not temper-amine, is the right read-
in ‚ for temperate is often used by Cic„ temperanter never. The
di erence between the two words would be infinitesimal in a
ms., the n being indicated only by a horizontal stroke ovef the
a, which was often omitted.

vetant. This is the certain correction by Boot of the ms.
mlta. The influenoes which forbid him to adopt an but a des-
perate course are—‘ his character, his prevrous istory, the
nature of the ente rise on which he has embarked, the material
strength or even t e moral firmness of the Pompeian party.'
Ante facta is probably an allusion to the eom licity of Caesar
in the Catilinarian conspiracy (see Corres ongence of Cicero,
vol. i. pp.¹ 17-19), which is more clear y recognised in a
subsequent letter (Att. x. 8, 8), non est committendum ut iis
pareamus quos watra me senatus, m quid resp. dem-imm& caperet,
amavit. (Observe the strange ambiguity introduced into this
sentence by the anastrophe of watra, a figure which Cic. affects ;
cf. qvem ecmtra = ‘agamst whom,' Mur. 93 2 Verr. v. 153.)
Boot does not seem justified in 'vin to constantia the bad
sense of ‘ obstinacy ': I cannot nd t at Cic. ever uses the
word except in a. good sense. Indeed, it is contrasted with
‘ obstinacy ' in Mur. 31, quae enim pertinacia quibusdam, eadem
aliis constantia 'arideri potest. In this ge, however, Ι
believe that both vires and constantia, t ough bearing their
natural meaning, are used ironically by Cicer0, who does not
in his letters senously ascribe either material or moral strength
to the rtisans of Pompeius. Lehmann (Quaestiones Tullianae,
