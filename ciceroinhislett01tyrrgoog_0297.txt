LETTER XVIII. (Q. ΕΒ. 11. 9 [11])

1. οοᾱ101111. These were tablets made of thin pieces of wood
(codices, caudices) and covered with wax. Sen„ E . lv. 11,
contrasts episbuleu (written on paper) with codicil i. They
were used for any sudden exigency requiring haste, or when
calamus and chao-tac were not accessible. Sometimes the
words of a letter were hastily jotted down with a stilus on
these codicilli, and then given to the librarius to cop on
charta with a calamus. It was by codicilli that Acl inus
(Fam. iv. 12, 2) informed Servius at Athens that Marcellus
had died of the wounds inflicted on him by the dagger of
M ‘us Chilo, Codicilli were especially useful when an im-
mgffiate rcply was required. They corres ended to our reply-
postcards. Cicero sent his codicilli to bus (Fam. vi. 18,
1) when he wanted immediate information about a law. In
this case Quintus sent his codicilli to his brother, demandin
‘ in strong langpage ’ a reply. O'odicilli were especially use
for writing to t ose who were near at hand, Sen. loc. cit.

alumnam, ‘ to ramble on ' without an consistent train of
thought, just as Cicero and his brother o atted to each other

when they met.

2. Tenediorum. The people of Tenedos petitioned the
3:11:ng for Home Rule, but were refused. Cicero spoke in their

securi Tenedia. Tenes, the fabled eponym of Tenedos, was
the author of a very severe code for the island. Adultery was
to be punished by the immediate execution of the adulterer,
and this sentence was carried out by order of Tenes in the case
of his own son. Securis Tenedia is a proverbial expression for
any ‘short‚ sharp, and decisive ' act or decision.

3. L. Seetfl Pansae. Probably a publican, who had made
some excessivo demands of the Magnetes. The Magnetes of
Lydia are called Maynetcs ab simio, to distinguish them from
the Magnetes in Thessaly and in Caria.

neque tibi neque Pomponio. This must refer to some
transaction in which Atticus and Quintus were jointly con-
cerned, probably, therefore, affecting in some way the marriage
portion of Pomponia.

4. Lucretii . . . artis. This is the celebrated criticism of
Cicero on the poem of Lucretiu8‚ which had just been published,
