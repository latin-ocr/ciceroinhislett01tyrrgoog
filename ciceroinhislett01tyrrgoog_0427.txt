was he d in the Tem le of Tellus. Cic. too part in the
debate, and advoca a eneral amnesty. The senate ao-
cepted hia proposal, but ad ed to it a ratification of Caesar's
acts. Gaesar's friend& headed by L. Piso, hia father-in-law,
procui-ed the consent of the senate to the publication of Caesar’s

funeral which followed, and by Antony’s address on that occa-
