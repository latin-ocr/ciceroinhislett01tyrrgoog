lxxxvi CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

or Fulviniaster (which is often regarded as corrupt, but ’
is defended by Antoniaster, Fragm. Or. Var. 8); desidera-
tives like petiturit, ‘ he is keen about stending’ 3 Suda-
twn't, ‘ he is bent on a coup d’etat’3 proscriptumit, ‘he is
eager for a proscription': we have also salaco, ‘ a swag-

(the office of an apparitor); to which may be added
strangely-formed words, such as incmtsiderantia, obvi-
amitio.

aedificatiunmcla, ambulatiuncula, animula, assentatiun-
cula, atriolum, auricula, captiuncula, cerula, chartula,
classic-ula, commotiumula, contiuncula, deliciolae, dever-
soriolum, dextella, diecula, febricula, filiolus, sumina,
ylooiola, imayunculae, laureola, lectiunculae, lintriculua
litterulae, membranula, memoriola, nau-ceola, neqotiolum,
nervuli, ocelli, olusculum, oppidulum, paqella, paqinula,
planyunculae (probably a corruption of imayunculae),
