If the jud found that Trebatius had been ejected b armed
force and ad not himself been the ag essor by tge same
means, the injunction would be made fina , and the defendant
probably be condemned in damages: if his prior aggression

‘ There is, I think, no doubt that the interdici: referred to is
de ui armata (which in the Digest is consolidated with that de
ui, Dig. xliii. 16). Prof. Tyrrell erroneousl takes it to be the
interdict uti possidetis, and naturally finds ifficulties. He has
been misled by the langu e of Cic. Caecin. 22, ἕ 63, and Gai.
iv. 155, whence he infers t at no exceptiones were allowed when
armed force had been used. It is not necessary to assume in
either passage that such a plea as we have here was in question.
But that such a lea was allowable is, I think, clear (1) from
this passage itsel ; (2) from the analogy of the interdict ‘⁴ de
wV' (cf. Cic. Caecin. 592) 3 (3) from the reason of the thing,
sup rted by the language of the Digest-

e use of armed violence in matters of ejectment was
rightly held to be so contrary to the dignity of legal procedure
as to re uire erempto prohibition. Accordingly a person
who had imse f acquir possession from his opponent by force
(wi, not ui armata) or by stealth or by sufferance was et en-
titled to immediate restoration, if his op nent ejected im by
armed force. Obviously the same princl e applies against him,
if he has himself used armed force. §fis own armed violence
disentitles him from claiming the peremptory protection of the

his opponent from pleading the wron possession of the
former. Indeed the two acts ma we have been successive
events in one day’s struggle. 1 Trebatius (in the su posed
case) had brought a body of armed men to dispossess fiis op-

Ι add the comment of Dr. Reid. [The statements in Cic. Caec.
are not to be relied on. He may not have said anything false,
but he has certainly concealed matters which make his account
of the law as it stood in his time utterly untrustworthy. And
the law had changed so much between his time and that of the
