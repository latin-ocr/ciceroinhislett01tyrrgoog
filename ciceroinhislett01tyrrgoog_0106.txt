xcviii CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

its text a great improvement on M, and there was not
enough scholarship at the end of the twelfth century to
make these improvements by the exercise of conjecture.
M. Thurot holds that Τ comes from the same archetype
(A) as M, but is independent of M.

(4) Hofmann (11611116 611 independent place for P, a
Codex Parisinus, including from Fam. i. to impediendi
moram, Fam. viii. 8, 6 3 and the same claim is made by
some editors for one page of 6 Turin palimpsest, which
includes Fam. vi. 9 and part of 10. Orelli, while class-
ing the Wolfenhiittel 1116. with the other codices ulti-
mately traceable to M, has remarked how desirable would
be 6 thorough collation of the codex Guelferbytanus. R.
Heine (Jahn's Jahrb, 1878, Seite 784) has examined
the ms„ and pronounces it to belong to the fiftcenth
century, and to have no value independent of M.

(5) Very important in the criticism of the letters are
the Editio Neapolitana (1474), and the editions of
Victorius, published-—one in Venice 1536, another in

Florence 155 8—as well as an edition preserved in the “

library of Zurich, of which the time and place of pub-
lication* are unknown, the last leaf of the copy being lost.
This is called A by Orelli, i.e. Editio Antiquissima, but
must not be confounded with A, the supposed archetype
of M, H, and T, nor with A, the Codex Ammianus,
containing the letters to AtticuS, QuintuS, and Brutus, of
which I shall have presently to treat. In this edition A
will mean the G'odex Antonianas. The other two 616
very seldom mentioned, and when they are mentioned
each will be given its full title.
