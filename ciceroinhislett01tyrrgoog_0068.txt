ξ 1. on THE FORM or THE LETTERS

In the time of Cicero the letter was written either (1)
on thin tablets of wood or ivory covered with wax, in
which the letters were cut in uncial characters by the
stilus, the characters being protected from defacement by
the projecting rim of the tablets ς or (2) they were written
on paper or parchment with a reed pen and ink- It
seems probable that the longer letters of Cicero were
written in the second fashion. We hav'e frequent allu-
sions to charta in the letters; for instance, in Fam. vii.
18 Cicero asks Trebatius whether he wrote on a palim-
psest, and if so, what could have been the writing so
worthless as to make way for the letter. So in Q. Fr. ii.
14 (1512), 1, it is plain that charta, calamus, and atra-
mentum were used. The same inference is to be drawn
from Att. v. 4, 4, and perhaps from the passage already
adverted to above (Att. vi. 6, 4), where Cicero avails
himself of the services of the copying slave of Atticus to
pass off on Caelius the letter written by himself, but
purporting to come from Atticus3 for Cicero's hand-
writing on charta with a pen would have been much
more easily recognised than his uncials carved with a
stilus on wax. Moreover, the use of pen and paper
would be so obviously more suitable for long letters that
we can hardly doubt that it was the vehiele used by
Cicero for his correspondence. Nor is there any real
