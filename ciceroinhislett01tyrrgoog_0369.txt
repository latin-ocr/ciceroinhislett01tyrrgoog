with much consideration in Att. vii. 18, 3, where he sa s that
he thinks Dionysius ought to eccom ny him in his ight if
he should fly from Rome ς ‘but,' he ds, ‘ we must not ex ct
too much from a Greek‚' and, ‘if Ι am obliged to send for im
(which I hope 1 may not be) you must see that we consult his
convenience in every way! It appears from this letter and the
next that Dion. flatly refused to romain an inmate of the house
of Cic. during this unha py crisis, but afterwards became
alsrmed and apolog-ised. ὀ. courteously dismissed him, ss we
leam from Att. vii1. 10. His conduct seems to have been most
ungratesul after this. In Att. ix. 12, 2, Cic. writes: ‘1 hate
him, and always shall. 1 wish 1 could make him smert for his
conduct.’ In Att. x. 16, 1, we read that Dion. a logised to

grateful Greek. [Does noster mean here ‘ our common friend:

veritus. This is the onl place out of Latin comedy where
vereri takes the genitive. 'ffm constr. is ascribed by Nonius to
Accius and Pacuvius. Their precedent, however, would not
justify us in ascribing the constr. to Cicero, the diction of
whose letters conforms not to the extreme archaism o'f Accius
and Pacuvius, but to the more modern colloquialism of Plautus
and Terence. However‚ Ter. (Phorm. 971) has the gen. with
²⁷⁶⁷· ῗῧίῗὲςῖζΐῖῗέἐῗ, ζῗὶῗέιέξῖἑῗῶἔέυᾞω’

Boot denies the applicabih’ty of this passage by making sminae
the dative after faceres contemneliam, and takin huius sis veritus
to mean ‘ did not care that (a snap of our gers) for.' But
the natural constr. is rightly recognis by grammarians, 041.
