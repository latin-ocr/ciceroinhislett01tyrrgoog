INTBODUGHON lxxvii

(9) In Plautus words like videlicet, scilicet, ilicet, arc,
as it were, resolved into their component elemento and
govem a case, as if (eg.) videlicet were videre licet. A
very good example of this is found in PL Stich. iv. l,
49, 51 :—

videlicet, pax-cnm fnisse illum senem . . .
videlicet, fuisse illum nequam adolescentem.

Hence, Ι believe it ie unsonnd criticism to change tum

observes.

iv. 2, 62. of. also quidquid valebo . . . valebo tibi,
Fam. vi. 6, 13, where Τ badly gives conciliabo tibi.

(j) The use of the ethical dative is far more common
in the letters and in comedy than elsewhere in classical
literature. In fact the ethical dative without en. or ecoe
is very rare in the other writings of Cicero, For this
