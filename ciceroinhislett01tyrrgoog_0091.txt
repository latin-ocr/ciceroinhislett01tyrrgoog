(1) A very interesting feature in these letters is
Oicero's use of Greek words and phrases. They were
the arqot of literary Rome. I have so treated them in
translating passages in which they occur. 1 have done
so even when I was forced to introduce a metaphcr not
even hinted at in the Greek word. For instance, in Att.
i. 1, 2, where Cicero says ut mihi videatur non esse ἀδύ-
νατόν Curium obducere, I render ‘ that it seems to me
on the carde to carry Curius against them) If Cicero
uses a Greek word where he could quite as easily have
used a Latin, we must take this circumstance into
account in translating. Greek words are also frequently
used as part of the terminology of rhetoric and politice 3
but the most interesting point connected with this feature
in the style of the letters is the fact that very often
Greek words are called in to supply a deficiency in the
Latin language, and that in those very cases in a num-
ber of instances our own languege faile, and we are
obliged to borrow from the French ; so that a French
word is not only the best, but the only, word to express
the meaning of the Greek term in the letter. This fact
is always taken notice of in the notes 3 but the following
list may be given here of Greek words naturalised by
Oicero to supply a want in Latin, and translatable by us
only in naturalised French words: ἀκηδία, annui ,· ἀδια-
φορία, nonchalame ,· δυσωπία, mauvaise konte ,· ὁδοῦ
πάρεργον, en passam ,· μετέωρος, distrait ,· μείλιγμα,
