road to a fortune neglected by Cicero was the practice of

usury.1 It is a singular feature in the social life of this
period, that men of the highest distinction lent money on

interest to individuale and corporations. Brutus, though
according to Shakspere he condemned Cassius for his
itching palm, had large transactione of this kind, and
it was thus that Atticus amassed the wealth which he
knew so well how to keep. Nor was this trade confined
to men. There is much reason to believe that Terentia

seriously embarrassed her husband by speculatione, in
which she allowed herself to be 'defi-auded by her steward

reputable in Rome. But Cicero does not seem to have sought
thus to add to his resources. He useS, in one of his letters to

Cicero is much to be reg-retted) for many years affor-ded to him
that intelligent sympathy in his liter-ary lsbours which he sought
in vain from Terentia. She was the Stella of Cicero. Thst the
intimacy psrtook in no degree of the nature οἰ an intr-igue is plain
from the friendly relations which subsisted between Caerellia and
Terentia. Yet the rancour of Dio Cassius has not recoiled even
from this asper-sion. Like Swift, Comte, sud Goethe, Cicero felt
