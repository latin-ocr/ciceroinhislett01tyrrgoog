we must calculate our dates on the rineiple that the Roman
months contain the same number of ays as they do now.

Nam ma Hortensiana. Cic„ in telling Att. that he is
under surveillance‚ adds that all his hopes founded on the
amiability of Hortensius have been dissipated, ‘ all the gush
of Hortensius turns out to be mere moonshine.’ The word
infantia is vel·{¹ probably corrupt3 whether we take-it as the

are a worse obstacle ιο me than the surveillance to which 1 am
subjected, (1 am under surveillanee), for the h of Hortensius
turns out ιο be all nonsense.’ Att. might ave 'udged from
the previous letter of Cic. that the surveillanee ο Hortensius

Ita. fiet, ‘ So it will be found ιο be' ; cf. quiescet, Juv. i. 126,
and Mayor’s note there. The most common example of this use
of the fut. is sic erit, ‘ you will find it to be s0,' which is frequent
in the comio drama, so that we need not regard with suspicion
a similar usage in the letters of Cicero. cf. ineo-mat, ‘ there
will be found to be in the purse,' Plaut. As. 7 27 ; cmweniet,
‘ you’ll find it right,' Ter. Phorm. 53.
