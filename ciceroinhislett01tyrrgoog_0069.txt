evidence to set against the passages adduced above, for
expressions like tabella, exaravi, etc„ are applied to the
use of pen and paper as well as to the use of cera and
stilus} When the letter was finished the tabellae were
bound together by a thread, which was scaled at the
knot. This seal was generally looked on as the formal
guaranty of genuineness, for the handwriting was generally
that of a slave, if the writer possessed sufficient means to
keep a servus α, manu or ab epistulis.

There being no postal arrangements whatever in the
time of Cicero, it was necessary either to employ private
messengers‚ or to avail oneself of the services of the
tabellarii of the publicani, who were constantly travelling
between Rome and the provinces.

For further information about modes of addressing
letters in Cicero’s time, see note on Ep. xxxiii. ἕ 1.

The earliest letter of the correspondence is written in
the year 68 B.o.‚ the latest in the year 43 ac. I have

all improbable that chartae would be enclosed between tablets of
wood or ivory and bound by a thread, so that the tabellae, even
though actually thus employed, would not necessarily imply the
use of the cera.
