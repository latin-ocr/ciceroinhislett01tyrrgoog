viii PREFAOE

Matius about Caesar. Thus, the great majority of
the letters now presented have not appeared before
in any Selection, and very few of the letters from xl.
to lxxx. have ever been commented on in English or
German before 3 the letters from i. to xl. have
already been treated in the Omespmzdenoe of Cicero,
by Mr. Purser and myself. ¹

In the Introduction, in dealing with Cicero as a
public man, Ι have confined myself to those epoche
in his career in which, as it seems to me, his char-
acter and motives have been misapprehended or
deliberately misrepresented. The Introduction is for
the most part abridged from the Correwondence of
(licem, where the subjects here treated are dealt with
in greater detail than seems necessary for those for
whom the present volume is intended, namely, boys
in the higher forms at the schools of Great Britain
and America. ’

Ι have had the invaluable aid of my colleague and
collabor-atem, Mr. L. G. Purser, in my comments on

, the letters not yet included in our joint edition of

the Correspondeowc. To him my best thanks are
due. But he himself would wish me to acknowledge
even a greater debt of obligation to one who, though
not a colleague, and influenced only by his love of
letters, and the kindliness of his disposition, has
conferred on me a favour which I could not overrate.

bridge, who has been good enough to read over all
