LETTER xxx. (Am. v. 15)

1. Ex hoc die, ‘ Oount the beginnin of my year from that
date.' Cicero finds that he has arrive within the borders of
his province one day earlier than he had expected3 and he
wishes this to be carefully recorded, lest his hated government
should be prolonged even by twen -four hours. We might
render ‘put a nick in the post for t e beginning of my year.'
The literal meaning is ‘ move on the pe ’ς Att. had to start
with Aug. 1 and move on the peg each ay one hole in some-
thing like a cribbage board. Oomnwvm is more usual in the
sense of ‘ to take in hand‚' ‘ put in motion’; but we have movere
in the phrase quieta mm movere, ‘ to leave well alone.' The
same idea is expressed by the words παράπηγμα ἐνιαύσιον com-
movete in the letter preceding this in the complete collection.
The phrase is said to take its rise from an old custom whereby
the Pontifex Maximus on the Ides of Sept. struck a nail into the
wall of the temple of J uppiter Opt. Max. to keep count of the
years. Of. mea si commota sacra, Plaut. Pseud. 110 ; nummus
commwetur, ‘ put into circulation,' Cic. Font. 11. Laodicea
was in Cicero’s rovince, which included not only Cilicia, but
Pamphylia, Pisigia, Isauria, the island of Cyprus, and three
διοικήσεις, Cibyra, Apamea, and Synnada, which usuall belonged
to Asia, and were only under the ovemor of Cilicia or a short
time. It was only between 56 an 50 that these assim-districts
were added to Cilicia, and it is not known for what reason. After
49 they were again under the proconsul of Asia, Fam. xiii. 67.

this use of the subjunctive cf. περανῶ illi, Att. 11. 12, 1, where
the subj. is used as taking up indignantly another's words, and
see note on Ep. ix. ἕ 1, videre noluerim .· cf. also Att. vi. 3, 2.
Slightly different is eoeerm'twm tu habeas, Att. vii. 9, 4, where
the subj. is merely exclamatory, like the accus. and infin. here,
