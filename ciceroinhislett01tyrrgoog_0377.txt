which Serapion brought, the latter would not have believed
that Att. had already recommended him ; so ‘ as a preliminary
to pffening ’ the letter of recommendation, Cio. told Ser. how

stricta. The readin of the mss. is scripta, which is
clearly wrong. Most ed . read lecta, which of course gives a

may maintain his present amiability (and assist me) ; since so
far nothing could be more courteous than his demeanour.’ It
is possible, however, that there is a certain humorousness in
the passage: ‘if the wind proves fair, Ι only hope the temper
