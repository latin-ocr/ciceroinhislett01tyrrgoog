xc CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

(7) 'Esse with adverbs is justly pointed to as a ehar-
aoteristie feature in the style of the letters by Paul
Meyer, p. 161. The following are examples: sic esse ut
sumus, Fam. xvi. 12, 4 3 tamquam ei tu esses itafuerunt,
Q. Fr. 111. 2, 23 Lucretii poemata ita eunt, Q. Fr. ii.
9 (l 1), 4.

So we find esee with recte, Att. vii. 17, 1 3 oommodis·
sime, Fam. xiv. 7, 2 3 tuto, Att. xiv. 20, 3 3 honeste, Fam.
xiv. 14, 1 3 flayitioee et turpiter, Att. vi. 3, 9 3 hilare et
libenter, Fam. xvi. 10, 2 ,- libenter et sat dias, Att. xv.
3, 2.

Α stranger use of esse with adverbs 18 where the adverb ’
18 predicative, and takes the place, as it were, of an adj.:
e.g. haec tam esse quam audio non puto, Q. Fr. i. 2, 93
utinam tam (so. integra), in periculo fuisset, Att. 111. 13,
2. See also Q. Fr. ii. 13 (15α), 4 (Ep. xx.)‚ quem ad
modam me censes oportere esse . . . ita et esse et fore,
oricula infima scito molliorem

In treating of the style of the letters of CicerO, I have
in nearly every ease taken my examples from the letters
of Cicero himself, but the same viewe are broadly applie-
able to the ninety lettere of his correspondents, Ι have
already pointed out how inferior they are, as a rule, in
style to the great master with whom it was their privi-
lege to correspond. But even in syntax and in the use
of words—in dealing with the raw material of literature
—they show themselves not to be by any means 80 care
