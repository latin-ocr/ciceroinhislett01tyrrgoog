lxxii CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

the correspondence as a whole, I shall give a general
sketch of the broad peculiarities of this branch of litera-
ture as regards the use of words, and offer a few observa-
tions on the distinctions which may be observed between
the letters of Cicero and of his correspondents.

A

There is a very remarkable. characteristic of the style
of these letters, not hitherto dwelt on‚¹ so far as I am
swam—a very close parallelism between their diction and
the diction of the comic drama2 It is, indeed, to be
expected a priori that the language of familiar letter-
writing would closely resemble the, language of familiar

dialogue. In both cases the language may be expected
to be largely tinged with the idiom of the sermo

vulyaris, or colloquialism.⁸ Cicero, in an important

² Stinner (de co quo Cicero in Epist-ms um est mone, Oppeln,
E. Franck, 1879) notiees this feature in the letters, but does not
pursue the subject.

² Cicero has in a passage already quoted expressed his high
opinion of the eleqantia of Terence: in off. i. 104 he lays down
that there are two kinds of humour—unum manate, petulans,
flagitiosum, obscaenum ; alterum elegam, urbanum, inqenioeum,
facetum ,0 and of the latter he makes Plautus a type, in this J'udg-
ment differing from the verdict of Horace (Ep. in Pis. 270 ; Epp-
ii. 1, 170) and'of Quintilian (x. 1, 99), but afterwards corroborated
by Gellius (vii. 17, 4), who pronouncesnautus homo linquae atque
deqoentiae im, verbis Latinae princepe.

⁸ It must be borne in mind that wrchaism is a large ingl-edient
in colloquialism, as has been pointed out (p. 127) in the very able
treatise of Paul Meyer, Unterwclvwnq iiber dale Frage der ththeit
des Briefioecheels Cicero ad Brutum. stuttgart, 1881.
