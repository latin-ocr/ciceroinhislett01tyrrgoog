176 NoTEs—xvll. (ΒΑΜ. v11. 1)

36 ; desinere seditionem in Gell. ii. 12, 3 ; and this construction
is not rare in the poeta. cf. orationes a pleneque legi sunt
decime, Cic. Brut. 123. [Not a parallel. This passage seems
quite as isolated in Cic. as Acad. ii. ἓ 80, where desinare is
consti-noted with abl. Looking to the number of times Cic. uses
decime, it seems stron ly improbable that either . e
should be sound. Ι would read arte desisterem here an desiste
in the other place. Desiste is now generally read for desine in
Ter. Haut. v. 1, 6. Neither Hor. nor Verg. has the acc. (for
in Ecl. v. 19 and ix. 66, desine plura, there is an obvious ellipse
of the inf. of a verb of speaking, and similarly in 1⁴:01. viii. 61).
So far as 1 can make out, there is only one ex. of desinere with
acc. in Latin before Cio„ πλε. Ter. Haut. ii. 3, 64, mulier telam
desinit.. Ter. uses the verb in about sixteen other placeS‚
either abs. or with inf. I cannot believe the pass. in the Haut.
to be sound. Probably Ter. wrote mre (cf. 1. 52) and a cop ' t
added the object telam, which then drove out the inf. Effe
ex. of desinere with accus. given in a fragm. of Sall. by the
Lexx. cannot carry much weight. Nor can much stress be laid
on the exx, from Ovid, for Met. vi. 215 quoted by Lexx. is now
altered3 and the interchange of desine and-‘desere in a good

context far better. 1 have not noted any other ex, of desino
with acc. either in authors of the age of Ovid or later down to
Sueten. (the passage ou quote), where it seems to me that
destituturos is the rig t readin . Tbere ia, I think, strong
reason for doubting whether t e constr. des‘e'mere with acc.
occurs in Latin at all, at least before Fronto, We cannot, of
course, argue that orationes desita aunt ῑῳί justifiae desinere
orationes, any more than or. coeptae emat ῑῳί would justify
coepisse oratione& Nor even if we found oratioroes doricae sunt
(without the infinitivo) could we say that it made desinere
m-atimws possible. Ε. 9., Cic. says illa coepta sum, but never
coepi aliquid]

6. relaxaro . . . emova, ‘remission . . . release!

6. reunques, ‘ You will not leave at the mercy of a letter
from me any hope you may have of getting enjoyment out of
the gameS. Siipfle understands these words to mean, ‘ You
will come and see me, and so you will not have to depend on
my letters for your entertainment when you will have myself.’
But this is a pointless remark, and does not harmoniae with
the foregoing sentence. Moreover‚ such a rendering hardly
takes aliquam into account.
