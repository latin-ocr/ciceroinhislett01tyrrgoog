130 NOTEs--L (Arr. 1. 5)

adfinem. Rather loosely used here: properl s king, Q.
Oicero only was the adfinis of Atticus, being t e {etisband of
Atticus’s sister, Pomponia3 not even Marcus, the brother of
Quintus, still less Lucius the cousin, was adfinis to Atticus in

strictness of speech. [In other passages a liberal view of
affinitas is taken, ey. Post red. 11.]

2. de sorore tua. For an admirable account of the pettish-
ness of Pomponia, see Att. v. 1, 2 (Ep. xxvi.) Cicero appears
afterwards to absolve his brother completely from blame in his
unhappy domestic relations.

curae fuerit ut. ‘ She will tell you how concerned 1 was
that Q. should have the proper feelings of a husband towards
her.’ A subject clause introduced by ut is not common after
curae est ; after which the subject clause is usually in the infin.
or is introduced by de, as de auqenda mea dignitate curae sore,
Ati} xi. 6, ἑξ. Of„ however, curae sore ut omnia restituerentur,
2 err. iv. 3.

eas litteras quibus. ‘ A letter of a kind to soothe one's
brother, to admonish one's junior, and to reprove one who is in
the wrong.’ The subjunctive is consecutivez if the verbs
placarem, etc„ were in the indicative the meaning would be,
‘ 1 wrote him that letter in which I soothed,' etc. An admir-
able instance of this consecutive subjunctive is to be found in
Ati.. vi. 1, 25 (Ep. xxxv.), where see note.

minorem. Q. was probably about four years younger than
Μ. Cicero—about 34 years of age at the date of this letter.

3. missione. Bembus conjectures immissione, and this
is accepted by Baiter, who compares Fam. vii. 13, 1, where
Cicero uses the phrase intermissionis epistularum, but that
supplies no reason why we should impugn here missione of the
mss. The phrase may be rendered exactly, ‘ You have no right
to complain of me as a correspondent ' ι quite similarly in Att.
iv. 16, 1, Oicero sayS‚ De epistularwn frequentia te nihil accuse,
‘ 1 bring no charge touching your requtarity as a correspondent,'
which is quite as natural a wa of s kin as if he had said
infrequentia, irreqularity. So ere e mig t have said inter-
missione, but did say (quite as correctly) missione. Of. Att.
v. 10, 3, ut meum eonsilium saepe reprehendam quod non . . .
emerserint, where eonsilium really means ‘my want of prudence.’
’ Of. Hor. Sat. ii. 4, 85, haee . . . reprehendi iustius illis, where

haee and illis are both regnant, ‘ their absence can be more - ’
