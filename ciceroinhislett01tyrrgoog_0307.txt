LE'ITER XXII. (ΒΑΜ. vn. 16) .

1. Equo Troiano. A lay of this name is ascribed both to
Livius and to Naevius, e proverb is usually su sed to be
sero sapiumt because Festus says, soro sapim ἔὲἕῃρεε pro-
verbium est natwm a Troianis qui deciano denique aomo velle
coeperunt Helenam quaeque cwm ea eram rapta reddero. But
accordin to Festus sero sapiunt Phryqes is the proverb, and he
says notfiing about its being a quotation from a play. Here
we have expressly a quotation from a play. 1 believe the words
quoted from this 3¹⁰5 to be in ato-emo sero sapiunt, referring
possibly to the
application.

in extremo, The words mean ‘when a man comos to
extremities it is too late to show the diseretion which might
have saved him.’ The is usually printed, im Equo
Troiano sois esse in extremo : ero sapiunt. But wh should
Cicero mention the pao-t os the play at which the wo occur?
Besides, sero sapiunt can hardly be called a sentiment at all,
while in eoewemo sero saffiwnt is a good proverb. For the words
ζῗᾞὲ ῖῖἳέ ῗὲἷὲὴξῖεὲἳζῗῆἵίῗέῗ ἑιωὲὲἔαὲὴὲῑῗέᾙῖἓέοέἳζῖἓέἲ
which it is too late to be sen'sible. The proverb, as Ι under-
stand it, fulfils the last condition, and says that ‘ when things
have come to an extremity it is too late to be wise.’ I need not
point out that the words as I have given them,

{m extremo sero sapiunt,

hrygians, but possibly having a genera

form the be ' ing of a good iambic verse according to old
Latin proso y and scansion. [The guestion may be put the
other way. Why should Cic. not o here what he does in
other places in makin quotations, πλε. indicate the art of the
work where the word{ come? The most serious ifficulty in
the way of your view ie, 1 think, that there is no parallel to
this use of in mremO, for Sall, Jug. xxiii. 2, suas fortunas in
eam-emo sitas will hardly justify this]

mi vetule. This address is merely playful. He calls
Trebatius ‘ my old fellow,' because he is cautious-has an old
head on young shoulders. He congratulates Trebatius on being
wisc in time, and seeing the folly of the spirit reflected in his
earlier letters—a spirit of impatience and discentem, and foolish
yearning for Rome.
