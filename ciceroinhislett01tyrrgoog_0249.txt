LETTER Ι. (ΑΤΤ. 1. 5)

This is the first letter of Cicero’s extant correspondence.

1. fluctu. ffimdu is not moment simply, but enjoymem
with profit. The latter idea redominates here. ‘ What a 10oe
Ι have sustained both in uqflie and in private life.' Lucius
was the cousin of Cicero· n Fin. v. 1 he expresses the relation-
slu'p more accurately in calling him fratrem aequatione
patruelem amore ymanwm. Lucius (2 Verr. iv. 25) travelled
in Sicily with Cicer0, to aid him in collecting evidence against
Verres, This explains forensi.

Nam mihi omnia. ¹ An the charm that one man’s kindly
nature may have for another, 1 felt in him.’ Iuewnda is used
plredliltgatively leggfi‘ffu the &Euge vcvhhgch capo come plagunt (gre
{fignd’s &effnessaof gagress a m) a man om IS

humanitate et moribus, ‘ his kindly disposition ’ ε a very
mitigated specimen of the ἓν διὰ δυοῖν so common in the pects
and in Tacitus. Of. Pro Cluent. 111, mores eius et adv-wantiam,
and Att. i. 12, 3, servatum et adamum, ‘ brought out safely.’
[Rather ‘ kindliness and winning ways.’ For this emphatic
sense of moribus cf. Prop. iv. (v.) 11, 86.]

omni . . . ornatissimum, ‘ graced by every charm of
character and rinciple.' Of. mommo offic-130 ac virtute viram
praeditum, 2 err. i. 135, ‘ a most obliging and excellent

fellow. '

tuique . . . amantem. Amne and other pertici les are
often used nearly as subst. ; cf. homines amantes tui, am. ix.
6, 1 ; observantem sui, Rab. Post. 43. If amntem were strictly
subst. we should require tuum amantem.
