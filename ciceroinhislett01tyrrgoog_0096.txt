(4) Moreover, nearly every adjective and adverb in
the language is intensified by the prefix per- 1 and miti-
gated by the prefix m. This is to be expected, owing
to the need arising in letters for conveying delicate shades
of meaning. This need demands also that minute gradua-
tion of the force of a word which the use of the compara-
tive and superlative can so well supply in Latin. Hence
the extraordinary richness of the letters in comparative
and superlative forms both in adjectives and adverbs‚ for
which see Stinner, pp. 12-15. These prefixes are rarer
in the case of verbs, but we have the following: per-
yaudere, perplacere, pertaedet, pervincere, subdiffidera
subdocere, subdubitarc, subinvidere, subinvitare‚ sulme-
9a‘re, suboffendere‚ subrinyi (= διαμυλλαίνειν), subvereri,
suppaenitet, suppudet. Of other verbs the most strange
are cenitare, flaccere, frum-ari, itare, muqiaenari, pimari,
suppetiari, walcari, edolare, repumere, restillare, oblau*-
9uescere. Cicero in his letters also affecte rare composi-
tione with e, ex, as eblandiri, effliqere, eluqm, monere,
, exhilarare.

(5) The foHowing very rare words cannot be brought
under any of the above classen. They are simply due to
the caprice of the moment: combibe ‘ a boon companion ’
(though we have compotor in Phil. ii. 42); obiratio ,-
involatus (of a bird) ; itm (for abitus) ; reflatus (‘ a
contrary wind ³) 3 sponsus (gen. -us 3 for sponsum); noctua-
bandus, involyare (i). In all these cases there were
, other ter-ms quite as suitable to express the exact shade

¹ finesic of per with adjectives and verbs is found only in the
comio poets and the letters and dialogues of Cicero.
