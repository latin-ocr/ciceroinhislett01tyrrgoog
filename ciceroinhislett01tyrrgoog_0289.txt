(see Gothofied on Cod. Theod. 15, 1, 53).

Eoehedrae, or public lecture-rooms, were a very common form
of publio building, aq. Herod (in J osephus, B. J. 1, 16) Βύβλῳ
δὲ τεῖχος καὶ ἐξέδρας τε καὶ στοὰς ἀνέθηκε ; and often in Inscrip-
tions (Gruter, lxv. 3 ; clxxii. = Orelli, 3283, where, again, they are
joined with porticus) we find their builders notif ⁰ g the erection.

For example, in a somewhat long title of the Digest (9, 3),
where there are eopious enaotments as regards the liability of
people who throw t “ out of the windows (Dc his qai
effuderim vel deiecevint), ian (Law 5) gives us some know·
ledge of how people lived in l'odgings. The passage is interest-
ing, so it may be quoted: Si vero plures diviso inter se cenaculo
[i. e. ‘flat ’ or ‘stor ’ ; ef. Plaut. Amph. 1ii. 1, 3, where Jupiter
says he is the fel ow in superiore qui habito cenaculo, who
lives in the top story.’ Uenaculum later oame to mean of itself
‘ an upper story,' and quite early had lost its sense of dining-
room, as much as our ‘ drawing-room ’ has lost its signification]

unde effusum est. Si quis gratuitas habitationes dederit libertis
et clientibus vel suis vel umori-5, ipsum emwm mmnim teneri

eet. Interdum tamen, quod sine captione actm-is fiat [‘ if not

mean ‘ sitting-mom ¹ ; but Marquardt is wrong in saying that in
vitruv. 6, 3, 8, and 6, 7, 8, euchedrae must mean ‘sitting-rooms.’
