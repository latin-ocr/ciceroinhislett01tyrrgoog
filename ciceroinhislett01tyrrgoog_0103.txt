INTBODUGTION ’ xcv

letter of Petrarch to Cicero in the other world, dated
‘ apud superos Verona, June leth, 1345 ’ ; that the pla-ce
of finding the ms. was Verona has been inferi-ed (not on
sufficient grounds) from the fact that Petrarch’s letter is
dated Verona. ’ Τ116 extant copy of this ms„ according
to Dr. Vicrtel, is not by Petrarch.

But Dr. Viertel maintains that not only did Petrarch

not discover the ms containing the letters ad Fam„ but
that he did not even know of the existence of these

letters. The grounds on which 116 rests his argument
are these :—

(a) Petrarch never refers to the Epp. ad Fam„
though 116 constantly quotes from Epp. ad Aa„ Quint„
Bmt.

(b) He never mentions a second discovery in his extant
lettere.

(c) In the preface to his own letters, 1359, 116 6611-
trasts the number of his own correspondents with the
fewness of the correspondents of ancient letter-writers,
referring to Brutus, Atticus, Quintus, and Gicero’s son as
the correspondents of Cicero.

(d) In 1372 116 speaks of the letters of Cicero as com-
prising tria volumina, plainly those to Atticus, Quintus,
and Brutus.

(2) The codices H arleiani in the British Museum.
