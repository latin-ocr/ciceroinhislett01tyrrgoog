the only adverbs in -ter in the Letters derived from adjectives

designing traduoers of Atticus, as is 0 001 from ἕ 2, quod erat
illi non nullorum artificiis inculcatum. The quarrel did not
arise from the fact that Atticus gave up his idea of going to
Asia to meet Quintus ; the words antea saepe et vehementius post
sortitionem provinciae show that it was prior to Quintus’s de·
parture for Asia. However, Cieero fears that this change of
plan on the part of Attieus may inflame the quarrel (Att. i. 16,
