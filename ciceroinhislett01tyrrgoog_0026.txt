xviii CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

between the Senate and the Optimates‚ was realised for
the brief period of Oicero’s consulate and the succeeding
three years. And even then it did not absolutely attain
to Cicero's ideal, for it cannot be said to have had
Pompeius at its head. We cannot fail to observo how
Cicero sneers at Pompeius as long as the latter kept up
friendly relations with the popular leaders. Sampsi-
ceramus, Arabarches, Hierosolymarius are all jibes at the
possible despot. It is only when Pompeius has broken
with the revolutionary party that Cicero uses towards
him the language of sympathy and respect. But he
never had for Pompeius that affectionate admiration
against which he struggled in the case of Caesar. We
have in a letter to Atticus a strong expression of his
belief that in Pompeius lay the only hope of the
Republic :- ‘ His is the only influence which touches my
feelings3 nothing else3 not the talk of the patric iss, now
really an extinct class3 not the cause itself, which has
hitherto inspired no resolute action, and is destined per-
haps to issue in crime. It is to Pompeius Ι must accord
the unique position, though he does not ask for it, nor is
the cause his own, as he says& but the State’s? 1 His
comment on the death of Pompeius does not speak the
language of real grief: ‘ I cannot but feel grief for his sad
death3 I found him an upright, good, and worthy man! ²
