Caesar asked Trebatius to write to him must have been the
very day on which Caesar had first heard that Pompeius and

neqotium suscepisse is not strictly true. ΗΘ expressly writes
Capuam sumpsimus, Fam. xvi. 11, 4, and he often speaks of a
commission he held to watch the coast, Capua being his head· ·
quarters (Att. vii. 11, 5). ΗΘ appears, however, to have re-
signed it almost immediately (Att. viii. 11, D, 5). [Suscepi-sse

went to Capua on Feb. 5.]

compensandam turpitudinem. I have adopted ΜΓ. Purser's
su tion in restoring otium here. [Sin autem etiam indwias:
