1 believe he wrote ex illo . . . lectiunculis, and that this
assage su plies another striking instance of the close parallelism
etween t e diction of the letters of Cicero and of the oomic

drama. For a good example of inverse attraction in Greek cf.

on as certainly right, but efore it probably iu drop ed out;
the simple abl. with consumere in Cic. is rare and very dloubtful]

comminus. While Marius has a distant view of Misenum,
those who left him to come to Rome have a close (too close) view
of the farces which Cicero found so tiresome. Comminus. for
communes is the admirable conjecture of Madv. (Adv. erit. iii.
158). Communes is usually ex lained ‘ hackneyed,' ‘ gewohn-
liche,' ‘ alltiigliche ' (Siipfle). ut this is not a meaning which
communis ever bears (communes loci, ‘ common places,’ in no

Bp. Maecium Tarpa (mentioned by Horace). He was
appointed by Pompeius to be public licenser of plays, like the
Lord Chamberlam amongst ourselves. According to the Schol.
(Comm. Cruq.) on Horace, Tarpa was agam appomted to dis-
glsirassffizglvipussame functlons, as presldent of a court of five memberS,

probavisset, ‘if only Tarpa gave his sanction we had to sit ,
οι11; the play.' The subjunctive is used because ea expresses
‘ the kind ' of pla s which they had to witness. The point of
the antithesis is t at Marius could choose his own amusements,
while Cicero and the other spectatore of the gamos were de-
pending on the taste of Tarpa. See Madv. ἓ 379.

stomached.' This is the genitive which Draeger, Hist. Synt.
