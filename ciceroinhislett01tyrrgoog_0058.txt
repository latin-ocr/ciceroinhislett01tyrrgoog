1 CICERO IN HIS LE'I'I'EBS

the letters forwarded by him were full of atrocious reflec-
tions upon himself, he opened the remaining missives,
and sent them to Atticus, leaving it to him to decide
whether they should be retained or sent to their destina-
tion. ‘ The fact that they have been opened,’ he suggests,
‘ makes no matter, for I fancy Pomponia has his seal-
ring.’ This, of course, strongly conflicts with modern
notions about honour, but the writer is supremely uncon-
scious that the act is in any way questionable.1 Yet of
those who would now look on such an act as worse than
a crime, how few would be capable of the high-mindedness

“ with which Cicero acted on his discovery of his brother’s

treachery l He wrote to Caesar a letter (of which we still
preserve the copy which he sent to Atticus3 Att. xi. 12,
2) completely absolving his brother from the suspicion
of having instigated his own hostility against Caesar, or
having urged him to fly to Greece, and begging the good
offices of Caesar for a brother under the recent sense of
whose baseness to him he must have been still smarting.
It seems to me that this is an act of large nobleness and
truly chivalrous feeling, quite startling when we remem-
ber the times in which Cicero lived.

'I'he character of Quintus is very remarkable. One is
familiar with the domestic bully, who in the world is an
obsequious sycophant. But in Quintus we have the
exactly opposite type. With his friends he is

J ealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel:

² The same observatione apply to a practice which Cicero
acknowledges that he adopts in giving introductory letters to ·
friends: see Fam. xiii. δα.
