INTRODUOTION lxxxvii

plebecula, pov-tauta, possesaiuueula, rauduseulum, ripula,
rumusculi, matula, sedecula, aemula, simiolus, sportella,
tectoriolum, tocullio, villula, vindemiola, vocula, vallicula,-
to which add the proper names Attteuh, Tulliola, and
(if I am right in my view of Att. ii. 1, 8) Romula-²

To these must be added the following adjectival
diminutives ε ary-nudus, hilar-ulus, mtegellus, mulus,
liyueolus, limatulue, long-uiue, maiusculue, minusculus,
miniatulue, misellus, pulchellus, widin-mulus, rabionulue,
refraetariolus‚ ευόιαφίοαίαε, tenuieulue, and the adverbial
diminutive meliuscule.

(3) There are many ἅπαξ εἰρημένα in the letters
which we may hold to be due to chanee3 that is, we feel
that, had we lat-ger remains from antiquity, we should
probably have other instanoes of their employment. It
would be uninstruetive to supply any liet of such words
(not elsewhere found in elaseieal Latin) ae pereffluator,
adiuuem-,² corruptrix, aberratio, remiqatio‚ consolabilis,
petasatus, candidam-ius, sanquinarim ; but the follow-
ing adverbe, though to many of them what I have just
said is applicable, may be eet down: assentatorie, de-
speranter, furenter, immortaliter (gaudeo), impendio,
irdtumauiter, perveeperi, turbulenter, vulyatiter‚ and
utique, which oeeurs about twenty times in the lettere,
and only thrioe in au the other works of Oieero.

¹ This list and the following are chiefly taken from A. Stinmr,
De eo quo O‘ieero in Epi-ululis usus est eet-mone. Oppeln, Franek,
1879. 'I'he elassifioation is my own.

² Cicero in his letters affecte words in -ton We have besides
those already quoted the followingrare examples z approbator, eon·
vector, ioculatoro). eapilator, propaqator 3 to which add eompmke.
