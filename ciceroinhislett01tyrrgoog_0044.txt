Oicero is presented to us even at the very commence-
ment of his correspondence as being in easy circumstances.
He already possesses his estates at Formiae and Tus—
culum. We find him in the year 67 looking out for
objets d'art for his yymnasium at Tusculum, and he is in
a position to pay some ‚2170 for certain statues made of
the κογχίτης λίθος, for which Megara was famous. He
had inherited from his father an estate in Arpinum, in
the neighbourhood- of the two country houses of his
brother Quintus, Arcanum and Laterium 3 and a house
in Rome on the Carinae, which he seems to have made
over to his brother Quintus,1 when he himself, after his
consulate, bought for nearly 330,000 the magnificent
house of M. Crassus on the Palatine, which brought on
him so much envy and misconstruction. The marriage
portion which he received on marrying Terentia, at the
age of 29, amounted to about 33400. But even before
this time he was in a position, in the years 79, 7 8, to
make a tour through Greece and Asia. What, then, “
were the sources of Cicero’s income, for there is no

from him, and standing there motionless he read through a great
part of the book3 then he gave it back to the boy and said,
This was a yreat orator, my child, a great orator and a man who
lwed his country well. ’³ ⁹ ’
