INTROD'UOTION lxxxv

de mortui& Cicero invariably has οὔχ ὁσίη φθιμιένοιιι-ιν,1
and the proverb ne autor supra crepidam (often wrongly
quoted ultra) ² appears in Cicero in ite Greek dress aa
ἔρδοι τις. ⁸ Again, μηδὲ δίκην* ιε audi alteram partem,·

a lapsus memoriae is a μνημονικὸν* αμάρτημας viva voce
is ζ’ὣσα φωνή· , εενίαίύη is κατὰ μίτον 01· κατὰ λεπτόν· ,

comme (in the sense in which we uae the word in the
phrase Comme Poetarum) is σῶμα; and muta persona
is κωφὸν πρόσωπον.

D

The following are the most characteristic uses oi
words 3-

(1) Strange words coined to suit a momentary need,
euch ae Pseudo-Cato (‘Oato's ape '); Pseudo-damam,-
the curicus verbal facteon formed on the analogy of

φιλοσοφητέον which immediately precedes it 3 Fulviaster

² The verse is οὐχ ὁσίη κταμένοισιν ἐπ’ ἀνδράσιν εὐχετάασθαι,·
Hom. Od. xxii. 412. But Cic. writes φθιμένοισιν = see Att. iv,
7, 2. He makes a similar μνημονικὸν ἁμάρτημα in writing Δρα-
memno for Uliam in de Div. ii. 63.

² The proverb is derived from the story of Apellea, who accepted
the cobbler's criticism when it referred to the loop (ansa) of a
sandal (crepida) 3 but when, elated by his succesa, the cobbler
began to criticise the leg of the figure (cavillante cia-oa orm)
Apelles warned him ne cuper mpidam iudicaret, ‘ you must not
criticise hithr up than the eandal,’ Plin. H. N. xxxv. 36, 12.
Supra is the word used by Valerius Maximus also in telling the
same story 3 ultra has no authority, and, indeed, no meaning.

⁸ ἔρδοι τις ἣν ἕκαστος εἰδείη τέχνην.--Α1·. Vesp. 1431.

⁴ μηδὲ δίκην δικάσῃς πρὶν ἂν ἀμφοῖν μῦθον ἀκούσῃς.-ΡΙιοογ1ἰᾱοει.
