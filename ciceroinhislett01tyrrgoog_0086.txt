lxxviii CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

all, at last, lo and behold you with my consent, the point
was conceded! The vigorous exclamation is justified by
the unexpected announcement that Cicero himself was
for· conceding the request of Serranus, which was so
adverse to his intel-ests. It seems to me most unscien-

cx to in before illo cubiculo. But if Oicero wrote the
