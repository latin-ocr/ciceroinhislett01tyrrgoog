LETTER xxxlx. (Aa-r. v1. 9)

1. in Piraeea. See Att. vii. 3, 10, where he discusses the
Latinity of this expression.

σύγχυσιν litterularum, ‘again, when 1 o ened the letter, Ι
was startled at the illegibili of the han writing, for your
writing is generally most exce ent and legibles’

quod ita scripseras. Here is a somewhat carelessly ex·
pressed sentence. The meaning is that he had at first reason
to infer that Atticus was in bad health from the shortness of
the letter and the badness of the writing, and that on reading
the letter he had Atticus's own word for it. This, it will be
seen, is not very clearly essreaeed ε ‘ On my first sight of the
letter, before Ι broke the s , 1 was surprised at its shortneSS,
then, on opening it, at the badness of the writing, and, finally,
I discovered from your own statement therein that you were
suffering from fever when you arrived at Rome.’

Ille . . . incommode, ‘ He said that such was your impres-
sion of the case and his own, and such were the accounts he
received at home from your people, that nothin serious could
be the matter’ ; ita . . . ut must often be carofixlly rendered.
Saelssfgrgspoydence of Cicero, 12, p. 66. For esse with adv. see
i · . , 0, 1.

Id videbatur, ‘ What seemed to confirm this view was the
expression you used in the end of the letter that you had a
sliqht attach of fever when you wrote!

te amavi, ‘ I was greatl pleased with you.’ Ι have inserted
te, which has been corrupte mto cl in M.—a very common mis-
take. M. gives clamavi, which Victorius corrected to amavi,
Orelli to adamam, and Klotz to adama-vi. Cicero would not
use amavi or adamavi absolutely, nor would he make them take
as object the clause quod—Mpsisses: cf. amavi amorem ταωνι,
Fam. ix. 16, 1 ; in Atilii negotio te amavi, Fam. xiii. 62; volo
ames mmm comtantimn, Att. ii. 10 ; Ala-tidie mantem amabam,
Att. vii. 2, 3. [Is it so certain that clamavi is wrong? Of.
Div. ii. 5 60, clamoremque maiorem cum admiratione ; De Or.
i. 5 162, clamores et admirationes ,· Parad. 5 37, admirantem,
clamores tollentem ; Orat. 5 136, exclamatio . . . adnm-ationem]

2. τοῦ «popano, ‘ Keep‚ an ou love me, keep your very ownest
e e on the philotimoasness o the Unread Reckoner3 and as to
t is legacy from Precius-—which is indee a great sorrow to me,
