Att. vii. 14, 3, on the analogy ofidemtehortor, Q. Fr. i. 3, 4;

Mareellus and Cornelius Lentulus Orus.

potiendi (where see Madv.) Tge fact, however, t at audiendi
has in this sentence an object aliquid, and that another gen.
follows, makes it slightly different from the other exemples
cited above, end induces me to follow Bosius in ohanging eqo
to erqo. [It seems hardly possible that quor-mn erqo ean be
right. Erqo with gen. only occurs in cio. in quotations from
or imitations of the language of statutes: thus four times in
De Leg. ; also Att. iii. 23, ς 2; and De Opt. gen. die. ἓ 19.
