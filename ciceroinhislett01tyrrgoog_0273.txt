LETTER XI. (Flu. v. 4)

1. collega, Lentulus Spinther.
immutatum, ‘ turned against me.’

obstrepere, ‘ obtrude my letters on you,’ ‘ din my letters
into your ears.’ [Of. Att. vin. 1, 4, eqo si sommum capere possem
tam longis te epmolis mm obtumderem3 Fam. v. 14, 3.]

2. orationem, on the motion of Lentulus for Cicero’s recall.

quantum tue. fert voluntas. This is to be taken, not
with ut serves, but with peto ; it means, ‘I beseech you as
strenuously as I may without offendin you.' Otherwise, sert
must be changed to serat, or feret, whic Wes. reads.

tuoe mecum serves, ‘by aiding me (Ι beg γοα) to do a
service to your whole family,’ referring te his promise below,
omnibus in rebus mc sore im. tua potestate.

tuorum. Clodius, whose sister was the widow of -the
consul's late brother, Metellus Celer.

'ru tuae inlmleitiae, ‘ you have compelled yourself tc res'
a private (personal) grudge (see Fam. v. 1) for the sake of t e
State. Will γοα be ersuaded to injure the State to make the
spite of another (πλε. lodius) more effective ἲ ’

eam vim, referring especially to the violence with which
Clodius foiled the attempt of J an. 25 in favour of Cicero·

vide ne, ‘ take care lest afterwards, when γοα would gladly
recall the opportunity you now have for restoring all your
follow-citizens to safety·and happineSS‚ you may find yourself
unable to do so (as there may not then be one whom you can
even save from utter ruin).’ Such is the explanation of Orelli.
The following are his words: sanissima est ista &emmila per-
acuta propter oppositionem verborum reservandi et servandi, sed
varie corrupta a criticis. Hoc dicit.- ‘vide m, oumfrustra in
eo labores, ut revoces nuato tempus illud, quo omms in republica
illaesi atque incolmms reservari eciam tunc poterant, id ipsum
efficere mm possis, cum nemo iam omnino erit, qui wat vel
servari dumtaaeat (id quod minus eciam esc quam reservari).’

But this‘antithesis between servam: and reservam: seems to me
to need defence ; and, feeling this, most edd. give servandorum
