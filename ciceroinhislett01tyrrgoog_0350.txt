copies of· letters from the different civitates in Cilicia offering
contributions.' The first alierum refers to the latter point (as
often: see Fam. vii. 26, 1 ; i. 7, 1), with which Cicero deals,
by expressing his regret that the fame of the purity of
lus administration had not found its way to Bome; warning
Caelius that he could not allow, nor Caelius accept, any sub-
scri tion of money from the province; and im ressing on

'us the ter necessity for circumspection in ’ case, as
he (Caelius) ‘ alised himself by the severity with which
he had Proeoeughgn provincial malfeasance. Thon he turns to
the first point, and says it would not be respectable to have a
publio panther-hunt in his province. Boot has clearly shown

“ that the reference cannot be to Fam. viii. 9, as Man. supposed.

The offer made b the province to Caelius was a money vote
for his gamos, such as we read of in Q. Fr. i. 1, 26. [3 Aa civi·
mtes ,· ad and a are often confused. The abl. would follow the
change to a. Caelius sends Cicero a letter about the panthera,
and encloses letters for him to send on to the civitates]

iam pridem. Ι agree with Boot, who brackets these
words. Cicero distinctly says above, Att. v. 19, 2, that he
had never seen her: he now writeS, ‘Your daughter’s lite-
ness in sending her love to me was the greater because s e was
sending it to one whom she had never seen.’

Litt. datarum dies, ‘ The date of your letter pleasantly
reminded me of the celebrated cath Ι took ’ (for which see
Fam. v. 2, 7). Pridie Kal. Ianuar. is inapposition with dies ,-
it would have been more normal if he had written qui suit, as
in Att. iv. 1, 5, pom-idio in senatu qui suit dies Nonarum
Septembrium. We have a parallel to the construction used in
this passage in Fam. xvi. 3, 1, is dies fuit Nonae. The Latin
reads, however, as if something more than a mere date was re-
ferred to ; perhaps Att. had used some half-humorous historical
era, as Cic. did when he dated his letter (Att. v. 13) ’,οη the
560th day after the battle of Bovillae,’ that being the name
which he gives to the fray in which Clodius lost his life.

Magnus praetextatus. ‘ A Pompeius in a coya praetenta!
Pompeius would be May‘hus paludatus. My friend and col-
league, Rev. T. T. Gray, acutely suggests that in the well·
known passage stat mayni nominis umbra we should write
Maqni. Pompeius is called Maynus in the letters, very fre-
quently, and elsewhere, ay. in catull. lv. 6, in Magni simul
ambulatione ; Mart. xi. 5, 11, eum Caesare Maqnus amabit ; so
all through Lucan.
