NOTEs—XIII. (ΑΤΤ. lv. 4b) 157

Lentulum. P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther was the son of
the consul for this year (57) of the same name, who was active
in the restoration of Cicero, and was afterwards proconsul of
Cilicia 698. Lentulus, the son, was made augur this year,
whence the date of this letter is inserted. He was adopted by
Manlius Tor uatus into the Manlian qen-apso that he mi ht
become eligib e for the augurato. Man. says that it was or-
bidden by law that there should be two augurs of the same qens.
Now one of the existing augurs was Faustus Corneliae, son os
the dictator Sulla. Hence by his ado tion he eluded this
statute. The Latin phrase for ‘ to elu e a law ' is fraudem
facere leq-i. Hence in the words fraudem fecit above there is,
perhaps, a satirical allusion to the host at whose table Cicero
incurred his ailment. The Aemih'an law layed him false, as
his host had played false with another statu . [All the details
are in Dio Cassius, xxxix. c. 17, who makes the law apply to
every Ζερατεία, not the οἱωνισταὶ only.]

consistere, ‘ to stop ’ ; the word is used in a slightly dif-
ferent sense, though applied to a disease, in Cels. iii. 2, viden-
dum an morbus increscat an consistat am, minuatum, where
cmistat means remains anchanycd, neither better ‘nor worse.

[a. beta et a. malva. The ἣξει). shows there is a humorous
personification, ‘ entrapped by r. Beet and Mr. Mallow.']
