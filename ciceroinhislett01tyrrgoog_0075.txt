INTRODUOTION lxvii

of editions, which, as we have seen, is more than prob-
able. Nor can we accept the view of Nake that the
collection which we now have was posterior to the much
fuller collection, of which there is undoubted evidence.
The paucity of lettere to euch remarkable personagee ae
anear and Pompeius is fatal to euch a supposition3 for
we know that the large collection contained books of euch
letters: how, then, can we account for the fact that the
emanet collection which we possess presente us with very
few letters to those eminent persone? The argument on
which Nake most relies for hie theory that the lettere,
as we now have them, were first published in the begin-
ning of the second century Ap„ ie the fact that Fronto 1
made a collection of elegant extracta from Cicero’e letters
—a fact which seems to me in no way to support his
hypotheeie‚ but rather to tend to subvert it.²

² L. Gurlitt, in an able essay (Gottingen, 1879), maintaine that
there never was any lar-ger collection than thoee which we have.
He explains the allusione of Nonius and other grammar-iana aa re-
ferring to the collectione which we possess, or ae being corrupt, or
as instancee of negligence or stupidity on the part of the gram-
marian. With regard to N onius, he quotes with approbation the
words of Biicheler (Rhein. Mne. 596), quocum qui comparari
posset levitate et stupiditate neque antiquitas mque nostra aetas
wlbwm yrammatioum tulit.

Gur-litt strongly holds the theory that Tiro was the editor.
