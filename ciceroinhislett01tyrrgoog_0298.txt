about four months after the death of the poet. Itis 1118 only
1888 where Cicero mentions Lucretius, and he never quotes
gom the poet, though his philosophical works undoubtedly
show acquaintance with the m libri· de rerwm natura. It has
been observed that itis 881 1118 practice of Cicero to quote from
1118 contemporaries. He never mentions Catullus, who 88
prettily eulogised him in the poem (xlix.) beginning disertm-
sime Romuli nepotum. Cicero twice imitates an ex ression of
Catullus. He writes· macula infim molliorem, Q. ,11. 13, 4;
cf. Cat. xxv. 2, mollior . . . imula orimlla5 and again, Att.
xvi. 6, 2, 118 speaks of ocellos Italiae υἱὶῑτιῑω meas, which
seems to be 8 reminiscence of Pmimwlarwm, SirmiO, imular-
Ooelle, Cat. xxxi. But he never mentions the poet, with
whom he was linked 88 11811 by political sylfipathies as by their

1118 poem of Lucretius may be true, in 8 118 of the silence of
Cicero concerning Lucretius. Cicero probably some time
during the 1881 four months read (or heard read 1ο 11118) 1118 de
rerum natura, and had 8881 11 to his brother on finishing it.

Ennius and Attius, but 8188 much of the art of the poets of the
new school, among them even Catullus, who are fashioning
themselves on the model of the Alexandr-ine poete, especially of
Callimachus and of Euphorion of Chalcis. This new school
Cicero refers to 88 1118 νεώτεροι (Α11. vii. 2, 1), and 88 hi cantores
Eup hoo-ionis (Tusc. iii. 45). Their oers seemed 18 Cicero almost
incompatible with the ingenium of the old school. This criti-
cism 88 Lucretius 18 881 only quite ’ust from Cicero’ s point of

to Klotz will not let Cicero say what he thought. They insert

either inyem’um or ars. The point of 1118 jud ent is ythat
Lucretius shows the enius of 1118 old school, an (what mi ht
