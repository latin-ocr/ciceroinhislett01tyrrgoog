CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

Gronno’s extant correspondenoe commenced B. 0. 68.
Cicero was then 38 years of age. Ten years before
he had returned from his travels in Greece and Asia,
and shortly after his return (aged about 29) had married
Terentia. At the age of 17 he had served under
Cn. Pompeius Strabo in the Marsic War. He had
distinguished himself by his speech for P. Quinctius
(13.0. 81), and by his daring defence of Sex. Roscius
Amerinus and an Arretine woman (13.0. 80), against
the power of Sulla. He had afterwards, in his defence
of Q. Roscius Comoedus (13.0. 76), more clearly shown
his great qualifications for the Bar, and had filled the
quaestorship at the age of 31 (13.0. 7 5). But it was not
until he was 36 years old (two years before the date
of these letters) that his public life may be said to have
begun with the prosecution of Verres (11.0. 70). The
year after this famous prosecution he became curule
aedile, and while holding that office defended A. Caecina,
and made the speech for M. Fonteius, charged with mis-
government in Gaul. Except the treatise De Inventione
Rhetorica (13.0. 86), Cicero had, at the· time when his
extant correspondenee opens, contributed to literature

only translations from the Greek, most of which he after- -

wards retouehed, as, for instance, the Proynostica of
Aratus. Of these translations we preserve only frag-
mentary remainS.
