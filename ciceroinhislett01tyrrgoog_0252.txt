The reference is to Lucceius, He mentions the name plainly
afterwards (i. 11, 1, etc. ; i. , 14, 7). It is, however, possible
that cuius emimus might be explained as 8 reference to some
general proposition in Att.'s letter. ‘I have a right to look to

6. De Tadiana re. Tadius had somehow got into his hands
the property of an heiress who was still a ward. He had held
her property for the two or more years which would give 8 right

the girl her lawful guardiam, Tadius, by the advice of
AtticuS, feadod his rescriptive right. Cicero expresses his

7. Epiroticam emptionem, ⁸ your purchase of a place in

Tusculano. This Tusculan estate of Cicero had formerl
belonged to Sulla, and had subsequentl passed into the hand}
of Catulus. About eleven years after tffis time Cicero offered it
for sale (Att. iv. 2, 7), but he seems to have changed his mind,
for we find it in his hands at 8 subsequent AEeriod (Att. xii.
41, 1). Mr. Watson in Appendix V to the st rt of his
Select Letters of Cicero gives a list of Cicero’s ot er estateS.
