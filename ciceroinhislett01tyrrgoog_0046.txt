xxxviii CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

who had been for some time an inmate of Oicero's house,
left him heir to a sum equal to about ιιΕ’,85,ΟΟΟ 1 Of a
truth—

Sapiens uno minor est Iove, dives,
Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex denique regum,

if he can make such bequests to his friends or hosts.
But the grandem· of the legacy is as nothing compared

with the coolness of the legatee, Diodotus mortuus est ,-

' reliquit nobis H. S. fortasse centies (Att. ii. 20, 6), and

then he passes to other trifling topics. Malaspina is no
doubt right in reading sestertia omum, about 288 50. At
the age of 61, in the year 45, Oicero did receive a
very large legacy from Cluvius, which he tells us brought
in nearly 3700 a-year, and afterwards over 3800:
vehementer me Cluviana delectant} he says to his friend
Atticus when he discovers how valuable his legacy is

about to prove. Cicero appears ² to have been able to
serve the interests of this rich Puteolan by using in his

favour his influence with Q. Thermus, who governed
Asia as pro-praetor in 51. There seems to have existed

in Ancient Rome a testamentary mania, in consequence
of which distinguished public characters often became
the heirs of men personally quite unknown to them.
The obscure millionabre loved at his death to divide his
riches between two or three of the most eminent public
characters of the day. It was not a tribute to the

character or the politice of the legatee. Such bequests
were thought to reflect distinction on the testator. Caesar

and Cicero were co-heirs of Cluvius; and Cicero was
1 Att. Σίν. 9, 1. ² Fam. xiii. 56.
