(1) Μ, the Mediceau, This ms, is of the eleventh
century. It has always been held until quite lately that
we owe all our knowledge of the letters of Cicero to
Petrarch. It is certain that about the year 1345 he
found (at Verona probably) the letters to Atticus, Q.
(licem, and Brutus. It has been generally supposed that
a few years later he found at Vercelli the letters ad
Familiares. The Vercelli ms. still existe, together with
a copy ascribed to Petrarch. The Verona ms. is lost,
and a copy of it (also ascribed to Petrarch) is our chief
authority for the letters to Atticus, QuintuS, and
Brutus.

This opinion, which has been held since the revival of -

learning, has recently been vigorously and successfully
(as it seems to me) assailed by Dr. Anton Viertel.1 He
leaves untouched the belief that Petrarch was the dis-
coverer of the ms. containing the letters to Atticus,
Quintus, and Brutus. This is plain from the famous
