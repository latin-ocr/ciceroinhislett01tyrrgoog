INTRODUOTION lix

M. Curius (Epp. lxv. lxvii.) was an intimate private
friend of Cicero and Atticus, to whom he bequeathed the
. whole of his property, which he had amassed by successful
practice of the trade of a myctiator for many years at the
Achaean town of Patrae, which was largely used as a
place of debarcation from Italy.

O. Matius Calvena (Ep. lxxiii), a common friend of
Cicero and Trebatius, was a warm admirer of Cacsar,
and a steady adherent to his cause. Cicero nicknames
him Madame and Galvma on account of his baldness.
His manly letter to Oicero (Ep. lxxiii.) on the proper
attitude towards the dead ansar has always been much
admired. It and the letter of Sulpicius on the death of
Tullia are the only letters in the correspondence which at
all bear comparison with those of Cicero himself. Matius
and Postumius undertook the management of the public
games given by Octavius, and did not satisfy Cicero by their
action in this matter. Prof. Palmer in his Introduction
to Horace, Sat. ii. 4, vigorously defends the theory that
this Matius is the person satirised there under the disguise
of Catius We are told by Columella that Matius wrote
a treatise of cookery‚ and books on fish and pickles, and
aimed at making Gastronomy one of the fine arts.

O. Asinius Pollio (Ep. lxxvii), the celebrated poet,
orator, and historian of the Augustan Gourt‚ born no. ¹7 6,
died ΑΛ). 4, in the eightieth year of his age. He was
the friend of Catullus, of (licere, of Julius Caesar, and
afterwards of Augustae, and the patron of Virgil and
Horace, and the critic of Sallust and Livy.
