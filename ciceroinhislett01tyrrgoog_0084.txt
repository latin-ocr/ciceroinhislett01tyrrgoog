lxxvi CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

sic habeto, tantum habeto with aecus. and infin.3 and
habeo =poesum with infin.

l (d) Oopioue use of ejaculatory phrases: at te Romae
nonfore! Att. v. 20, ⁷ 3 0 tempora l sore oum dubitet,
Att. xii. 49, 13 facinus indiquum! epistolam . . .
neminem reddidi-sse, Att. ii. 13, 1 3 esse locum tam prope
Romam ubi, Att. ii. 6, 2 3 hui l totiensne me dedisse,
Att. v. 11, 1‘3 me mimum! te incidisse, Fam. xiv. 1,

· 13 hemsmealuoe, Fam. xiv. 2, 2.

(e) Ieolated agreemente in the employment of a pecu·
liar word (or phrase), ae susque deque est, which is found
only in Plautus and oio. Epp. among elaesical writers.
Paul Meyer (Untermckunq, p. 127 ) defende expedire =
narrare in Epp. ad Brut. i. 15, 1, on the ground that it
ie an archaiem. On similar grounds I would introduce
attenderim in Atti. l, 2, as a Plautine word, and P1PU120
ac convicio for populi convicio in Q. Fr. ii. 10 (12), 1.
011 a like principle Meyer (p. 134) vindicatos tardare
intrans, in Att. vi. 7, 2 by durare intrans in Plautus·

Such cases as these wfll be notieed in the notes where
they occur.

(f) A very striking eoineidenee with the diction of
the oomie stage is illustrated by the phrase quid mi
auctor ee, Att. xiii. 40, 2 3 quid sim tibi auotor, Fam.
vi. 8, 2, where auctor ee is treated as a verb and takes
an object in the accusative. This construction is very
common in Plautus, e.g. ubi quadruplator quempiam
iniexit manum, Pers. 1. 2, 18 3 sitis ynarures hano rem,
Most. i. 2, 17 3 quod yravida est, Amph. iii. 1, 18, where
see Ussing’e note.
