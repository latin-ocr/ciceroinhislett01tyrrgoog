might take off the play on words somehow thus :—Avoid the

Treviri. 1 hear they do great execution, like their namesakes

LETTER XXVI. (ΑΠ’. v. 1)

Cicero was now on his wa'y to his province, Cilicia.

Ep. viii. 1.

mei in eo. The usual reading is et meo snm {pse testis.
But Cicero almost always has a genitive after testis, the other
constructions used by him being de with abl„ in with abl„ and
in with accus. The Codex Ravennae (R.) gives in eo, words
which may have ousted mei, and given rise to meo. For the
confusion between m and in, cf. Esses sin for esses me, Att. i.
10, 6 ; in hercle for mehercle, Att. i. 12, 3 ; in alam for malam,
Att. i. 19, 2.

ut ne. ΠΖ ne in final sentences, as here, is common in
Cicero and Latin comedy. It is also found in Varro, Phaedrus,
Suetonius, and the writer of the Bellum Africanum, but not in
Sallust, Livy (except in xxxiv. 17, 8), οι· Caesar (except in
B. O. iii. 56, 1). Ut m in sentences dependent on a foregoing
verb or noun is often found in the comio drama and in cicere,
