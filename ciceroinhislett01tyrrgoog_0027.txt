INTRODUOTION xix

The conspiracy of Catiline cannot be regarded as
having been really a move in the struggle for democracy,
or a serious attempt to revolutionise the State. Catiline
was not the political successor of the Gracchi, Saturninus,
Drusus, Sulpicius, and Cinna. Hc drifted into the ranks
of the insurgentes, who were at best political desperadoes
like Caesar, and was easily crushed by Oicem, who
deliberately exaggerated the dimensions of the conspiracy

to enhance his own glory in putting it down.
There can be little doubt that, had Cicero chosen, the

ξ Triumvirate might have been a Quattuorvirate 31 but he
· is faithful to his educa optima, the defection of Pompeius

from which he regrets in expressive phrase (Att. ii. 21,

. 3, 4). His only comfort is that he has now no rival in
ι Pompeius for the plaudits of posterity (Att. ii. 17, 2).

Clodius having gained his tribunate by concealing his
designslhgainst Oiccro (a strong proof that Cicero was
not the object of popular resentment), at once proceeds to
his revenge. After several enactments‚ having a tend-

! ency to conciliate the various classes of Roman society,

1 This is stated in so many words by· Cicero in the or. de pro·
vim-iis consulas-ibus, ἓ 41, me in tribus sibi coniunctissimis consulari-
bus esse voluit. And this pronouncement is abundantly confirmed
by Oicero’s private letters cf this period. See Att. ii. 1, 6, and 7, to
the words mm minu-3 esset probanda medicina quac sanaret vitiosas
partes reipublicae quam quae mecm-et ,· again Att. ii. 3, 3, from
the words Nam ficit apud mc Cornelius, where he distinctly says

ζ that he might have been a member of the coalition, but that he
‡ preferred to adhsre to the policy and party which from his boyhood

he looked on as the party of patriotism and constitutionalism. In
fine, he resolves that his motto shall be: εἷς οἰωνὸς ἄριστος

ἀμύνεσθαι περὶ πάτρης. b
