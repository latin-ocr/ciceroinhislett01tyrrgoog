say this statue had no other inem-iption but 06116, and why
does he introduce at all the mention of the other 6161116 near
the Hercules of Polycles? The solution of the difficulty is, in
my mind, this -06116, ακηά 006. should chame places. This
transposition Ι have accordingly made in the text. The
copyist of M. saw that the argument required that the statue
{212 1116 16111611611161666611
in a h to introduce Onus„ not much troubling himself
about the ogical analysis of the whole sentence. 0οΡ “ (10
1101, 66 6 rulo, go beyond the firs't step in an process of ou ht.
Now if 006. be ut in the first place, and nus. after, the w 016
argument may e thus paraphrased: ‘ Is it possible that Scipio
Metellus is not aware 11161 1116 t· grandfather was never
Censor κ 11 16 true, indeed, 11161 {gammo laced by him near
the temple of Ops, and supposed by him to e 1116 6161116 of his
ancestor, had no inscription on it but 006., 611011111 11161 11 1166
1116 6161116 of 6 person who had been Consul. ' indeed
would not have shown the statue not 10 have been the statue
of Serapion, who was Consul.] But another 6161116 standing
near the Hercules of Polycles had the inscription Onus.; and it
can be proved that it commemoratos the same person 66 1116
6161116 placed by Metellus near the temple of Ops. That the
two statues are statues of the same man 16 proved by the pose,
the dress, the ring, in fine, the whole work!

Both are statues of the same man ; therefore, as the statue
near Polycles’s Hercules had the inscription 011116, 1116 111611
commemorated by the two statues must have been a Censor3
but Scipio Naslca Sera ion had never been a 0611601·;

Both are, in Cicero's opinion, statues of Scipio Africanus
Minor, who was 1101 only consul, but censor with Mummius in
142 (see Att. xvi. 130, 2, videor mihi audvsso P. Africano L.
Mummio censoribus).

Cicero then goes on to say that when he saw the statue of
Afiicanus with the name of Serapion written under it, he
thought it was a mistake on the part of the sculptor, but he
now sees it was Metellus Scipio who made the error.

Orelli was not aware that X and Y are figments of Bosius.
He 16 1101 therefore conscious that in introducing the readings
of X and Y—COS. in both 16666, and item for autem—he has
foisted on Cicero the (in t is 6666, stupid) conjecture of the ,
generally clever but never very scrupulous Frenchman.
