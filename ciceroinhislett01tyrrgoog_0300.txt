180 noras—XIX. (Q. FB„ 11. 10 [12])

pipulo, convlcl0, ‘ noisy elamour,’ πλε. of the senators.
The ms. reading is populi convicio. Boot (Obss. Oritt. ad M.
Τ. Ciceronis Epistulas: Amstelodami, 1880) justly observes that
he does not understand how the consul was forced by the
clamour of the people outside to dismiss the senate. He would
read cmnmuni convicio ,· but m conjecture is far less rash:
pipulo is a Plautino word, and t erefore very likely to be used
by Cicero ; it would almost certainly be mistaken by the scribe
for populo, which he would naturally change to populi, to
obtain a construction. Asyndeton is quite a characteristic
feature in the letters' of Cicero, even asyndeton between
two words. For two words with asyndeton cf. patrimonio
fortuna, Att. xi. 9, 3 ; causae meae voluntati meorum, Att. iii.
13, 13 qtoermttibus postulantibus, Att. v. 21, 12; adamat

hired roughs of Clodius, a qraooostasi et madibus clamorem satis

of the weather bring the people outside to break up the meeting
of the senate ‘ with abuse,’ convicio? But it is uite credible
that the senators themselves should have shou down every
attempt to put a uestion to the house with abusive clamour
calling 011 the co to dismiss the house. Each senator wished
to go away on account of the cold, but did not wish to leave

behind him a house to mensures unacce table to him.
With this passage must discussed the wo at the end of
the letter, ut summam ' lum esset m Appio suae aedes

is true that in seasons of great cold there is a ter dan r of

Man. explains by observing that m the house of the consul,
which was frequented b crowds of visitors, and by those who
would escort 111111 1101110 111 the senate, a very large fire would
naturally be kept. But such an explanation is manifestly
puerile. This being so, Ι am disposed to explain the two
passages—the one in the b⁶ff¹m¹ing of the letter and the one
at the end—as jocular, or at east covert, allusione to the lack
of interest in public affaire, the inactivi and apath of the
senate, and the dulness of the business be ore them. 0 first
passage would then mean, ‘ Appius could only get together a
