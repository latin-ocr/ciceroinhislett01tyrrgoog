INTRODUOE'ION lxiii

the same time, and edited by the same editor 3 this has
been inferred from the fact that there is evidence of the
strict observance of the rule to exclude from one collec-
tion letters published in the other. This rule is only ·
twice violated. We find enclosed to Atticus (Att. x. 9a)
a letter from Caelius ιο Oicero which appears as Fam.
viii.16; and' in the same way a letter from Oicero ιο
Dolabella (Fam. iz. 14) is published again among the
letters to Atticus (Att. xiv. l‘Ia). That the letters to
Atticus did not appear before the death of Atticus
(32 Re.) is probable from the testimony of Oorn. Nepos.
The letters to Quintus and Brutus were published with
the letters to Atticus.

The Books of the ad Fam. are entitled according to
the person to whom the earlier letters in each Book ere
addressed. Thus the first is ad Lentulum, the second ad
Curionem, the third ad Appium Claudium Pulchram
The eighth consiste solely of letters from Caelius to
Cicero, It is probable· that the editor first published
twelve books, and subsequently added four others, the

thirteenth and fifteenth being addenda to the first
edition, the fourteenth consisting solely of letters to his
family, and the sixteenth of letters to Tire, wh0, as we

shall see, was probably the editor of the collection.
Subsequent ιο the extant collectione we have evidence of
the existence of much larger volumes‚ of which only
scanty fragments romain. These were probably made in

veniently be so named, as most of his correspondents were
familiares. Aa Diversae is bad Latin. Suetonius calls such a
series amicomm epp. See note on Att. ii. 13, 1.
