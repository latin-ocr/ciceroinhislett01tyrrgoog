IN TRODUGI'ION xcix

For the letters to Atticus, Quintus, and Brutus, we
have the following authorities :—

(6) M, the Medicean. This ms. was discovered by
Petrarch, perhaps at Verona, about 1345. The copy

which we possess of it was probably procul-ed by
Pasquino of Milan for Coluccio Salutato of Florence.

In two letters, from the word reperire, Att. i. 18, l, to
visus est et talis, nearly the last words of Att. i. 19, we
10oe the guidsnce of M, some leaves of the ms. having
perished. But for Att. i. 19 we have the assistance of 8
Codex Pquianus in the Medicean Library, collated by
Th. Mommsen, the celebrated historian, who has con·
ferred such 8 benefit on students of the letters by arrang-
ing those to Quintus in their true order.

(7) Ο. This is a name given to 8 ms. of which we
have no knowledge except from the marginal notes in
Cratander's edition of 1528, which, however, show it to
have been independent of M.

(8) W. Some leaves of 8 ms. of these letters are
preserved at Munich and others at Wurzburg (whence
the leaves at both places are designated W): these
eontain portions of books xi. and xii. They coincide
closely with the marginal readings in Cratander’s
edition, and are by some supposed to have formed a
part of O. ,

(9) Ζ. The G'odeae Tmmemkznus, now lost, our
knowledge of which is derived from the notes of Lam-
binus and a few quotations by Turnebus.

In addition to these real sources of knowledge, the
fabricated codices of Bosius were till quite lately believed
