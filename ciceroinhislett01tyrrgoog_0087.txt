easy in illo cubiade, why do all the mss. give us the diffi-
cult ex illo cubiculo? The fact is, that in ex illo cubiculo
tuo ex quo we have an example of that inverse attraction
which is common in Plautus: cf.—

i‘ndidem wado oritur facito ut facias stultitiYm sepelibilem.
P . cist. i. 1, 63.

ego te hodie reddam madidum si vivo probe
tibi quoi decretumst bibere aquam.
Aul. iii. 6, 88.

quid illum facere vis qui tibi quoi divitiae domi maximae sunt

Epid. iii. 1, 8.

Α familiar example in Greek of this inverse attraction
is βῆναι κεῖθεν ὅθενπερ ἥκει-80911. Ο. O. 1226.

Ι think I have now shown sufficient reason for regard-
ing the usage of the comic stage as having an important
bearing on the criticism of the letters. I have adopted
this view as a principle in my recension of the text.
In the criticism of Tacitus a parallelism from Virgil is
almost as decisivo in favour of a disputed reading as a
parallel passage from the works of Tacitus himself3 for
it is certain that the very keynote of the prose of Tacitus
is the imitation of the verse of Virgil. In the criticism
of Cicero's letters we may go farther, and say that to
quote an analogous usage in Plautus or Terence is far
more relevant than to quote an analogous usage from
the oratory or philosophy of Cicero himself.1

¹ We have seen that the dialogues, as might be expected, have
far greater affinities with the letters, as regards the diction, than
have speeches and rhetorical essays of Cicero,
