De Legg. i. 39. Here Epicurean ethice are wholly condemned ;
Academic ethice condemned indeed, but in a less degree. Now,
if we compare Acad. 2, 11, nam aderam· familiares mei
(Lucullus is speaking) docti homines P. et 0. Selii et Tetrilius
Royus qui se illa audimsse Romae de Philone et ab ipso duos libros
dicerent descripsisse, we see that two members of the. Selian
family were followers of Philo ; and however reactionary these
‘ two books ’ may have been, there is little doubt that ‘ in
the ublic lecturos which Cicero heard Phsso gave expression
to tll'at brilliant and negative crificism that he had inherited
from Carneades, leavin reactionary doctrines for rivate conver·
sation and his written ooks' (Reid, Acad. In p. 60).

2. Sed quonam modo. Cicero goes on to rally Trebatius as
to how his occupation will be gone if he becomes an Epicurean.
The Epicureans held that ‘ in the sphere of morale individual
feeling must be made the standard, and individual well-being

and Sceptics‚ Eng. TranS. p. 445, and the references), and that
‘ ples-sure is the only unconditional ood ’ (ibid. p. 446). How
then will Trebatius be able to use 310 legal formula in actions

the fair division of a joint roperty‘3 Further, if Trebatius is
a Fetialis, how will he be a 18 to swear by Jupiter, the stone,
and ask this fine old od to cast him forth from his fatherland
if he perjures himse f, seeing that the Epicureans know all
about the gods—how that they were ‘ perfeetly free from 'care
and trouble, and absolutely regardless of the world ¹ (Zeller,
p. 441), in fact, ‘ a society of Epicurean hilosophers ' (ibid.
p. 442), to whom caring for others outside their own circle, aud
mixing in civil society or in political lise was regarded as a neces·
sary evil, and only to be practised ‘ as far as 1t is necessary for
the philosopher's own safety ’ (Zeller, p. 463 ; cf. the sixth κυρία,
