xlvi CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

thoroughly French feature in his disposition is his hatred
for provincial life. ‘ I cannot express to you,’ he writes
(Att. v. 1 1, 1), ‘ how I am consumed with longing for
the town, how intolerably insipid is this provincial life?
A letter to Caelius (Fam. ii. 12, 2), in the passage begin-
ning Urbem, urbem, mi Rufe, cole, et in ista luce vive,
breathes the very spirit of the salon and boulevarcl.

It is singular that the correspondence of another great ,
letter-writer should be marked by the same overflowing
love for a daughter. Madame de Sevigne’s love for ‘ the
prettiest girl in Franco ’ certainly was not so well placed
as the love of Oicero for Tullia. Madame de Grignan
seems to have been selfish, extravaganu and cold-hearted
—not, indeed, nearly so lovable' as her brother Oharles
de Sevigne. Indeed we can hardly aequit the clever
Frenchwoman of assuming a role, and posing in the pic-
turesque attitude of the adoring mother.

Cicero speaks in the highest terms of his father and

semum dolori-33 In the speech for Rabirius (29) Cicero anticipates
an eternal existence for the souls of the good, basing it on the
instinctive belief of mankind: again, in the De Har. Resp. (19),
he affirms his belief in the existence of gods, grounding it on the
evidences of design in Nature. Again, in De Nat. Deor. (i. 37),
and in De Rep. (vi. 16), he speaks of an over-ruling Providence.
But it is strange how lightly his beliefs sit upon him, and how
little they influence his conduct: in Tusc. i. 74 he says that the
God who holds author-Ity in our breast forbids us to leave our post
without his leave3 yet we know that during his exile he clearly
and deliberately contemplatos the commission of this act, andbwe
hear nothing at all about any prohibition of conscience, or even a

hint that sels-destruction is unworthy of a good man. See note on
Ep. lx. 6.
