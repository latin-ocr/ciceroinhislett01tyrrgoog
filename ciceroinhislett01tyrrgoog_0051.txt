Hie ullowance eeeme very ample, amounting‚ ae it did, ιο

Doctor Panglose in the Hah-haam. Young Marcus

It ie a ead reflection ιο think what the consulate was

of the fleet of Antonius, which was immediately followed by hie
death, it was to the new consul, M. Cicero, that the official
despatch announcing the victory was sent.
