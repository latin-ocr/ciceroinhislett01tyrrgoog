παλαιὸν ἔθος, ἐπὶ δὲ τούτων τὸν Ἀρην καὶ τὸν Ἐνυάλιον. ἔστι δὲ
τὸ Δία λίθον τοιοῦτον. λαβὼν εἰς τὴν χεῖρα λίθον ὁ ποιούμενος τὰ ’
ὅρκια περὶ τῶν συνθηκῶν, ἐπειδὰν ὀμόσῃ δημοσίᾳ πίστει λέγει τάδε.

οὕτως ὡς ὅδε λίθος νῦν] καὶ ταῦτ’ εἰπὼν ῥίπτει τὸν λίθον ἐκ
τῆς χειρός. The stone was 3 flint, symbolical, no doubt,
of the thunderbolt. We may com ‘the all- dreaded
thunder- stone’ in Cymbeline, and ear Chapman speak
out loud and bold, when he renders ειπερ μοι καὶ μοῖρα Διὸς
πληγέντι κεραυνῷ κεῖσθαι ὁμοῦ νεκύεσσι μεθ’ αἵματι καὶ κονίῃσιν
(11.15, 117) by ‘though 1 sink beneath the fate of being
shot to hell by J ove 3 feu thunder- stomss a translation not
alto ether unworthy of Homer. This stone was one of the

be kept in the ytemple of Jupiter Feretrius3 cf. Fest. Ρ. 92·

trum was the peculiar mark of Jup1ter and 30 the Fetialis
became on the occasion of the solemnity symbolically a Jupiter,
cf. Servius 011 Aen. 12, 206 (Audiat haee yenitor qui foedera
fulmine sancit), where he says: Ut autem sceptrum adhibeatur
ad foedera haee ratio est quia maiore-⁹ semper simulacrum Iovis

Mi'olm‘r, or hammer, of Thor. ‘'Hammer is connected philo-
logically with ἄκμων(0111·1;. G. E. No. 3), which itself means a
thunderbolt( (χάλκεος ἄκμων οὐρανόθεν κατιών, Hesiod, Theo

official explanation of Polybius. Mr. Strachan Davidson,
Seleetions from Polybius‚p 73, makes a good 0330 for the
theory that Iovem lapidem means Iovem ει lapidem on the
analogy of such expressions as Patres conscripti: Patres et
