susurratores, ‘ croakers,’ or ‘ whispering messengers.’

equitem. The collective use of eques for ‘ the cavahy ' is
not Ciceroniau. Hofmann thinks that Caelius here intends a
joke, taking equitem in the sense of ‘a single horseman.’ [Not

vapulasse. This word is never used by Cicero of troops
being beaten, but is sometimes so used in Livy. It, too, is
somewhat colloquial, ‘ were thrashed.' [A very rare word in
Cic. Does it occur except in Att. ii. 14, 13]

Bellovaci. The lived about the modern Beauvais. The
modern names of rench towns are derived partly from names
of clans (especially in the north), rtly from the names of

c . eriva e, iv. 132.

neque iactantur, ‘ nor are these, uncertain as they are,
yet generally talked about.’ This use of iactari without any
sense of ‘boastin ' attached is common in Livy, i. 50, 23 x.
46, 16: cf. Caes. . G. i. 18, 1. For another much less com-
mon use of iactari see note on Ep. xv. ·

palam secrete, ‘ as an open secret.’ Compare perhaps
aperte tecte, ‘with obvious ardedness,’ Att. i. 14, 4: if we

the mere reports which have arrived: amongst some few they
are talked about as an open secret, but Domitius makes a
wonderful mystery about them. [I agree with Hofm.]

cum manus ad os apposuit, the gesture of one telling a
secret. Understand some 811011 words as tum demum παπαί.
[This has generally been taken to refer to L. Dom. Ahenobarbus,
consul in 54 Ro· But he and his ne hew Cn. were Pompeiane,
and 0110 (1008 not see why they 8110111 have gone about speaking
of the disaster with bated breath. If manus ad os app. means
thia-the passage must rather refer to the Caesarian On. Dom.
