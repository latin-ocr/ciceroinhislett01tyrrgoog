jestingly says 116 must have got from reading the De Republica

gravissimus. This word seems here to mean ‘very tire-
some,’ with a play 011 the ordinary meaning of the adjective.
[Possibly with an allusion to his obesity3 cf. Caec. (of P.
Caesenius), auctoritate non tam yram· quam empore. N 0 doubt
the man was a quidnam. also.]

habemus, ‘ the consuls will have been made ἐ Lehmann,
p. 89, defends habemus, the reading of M„ by sag-ing that the
present is sometimes used for the future to in ‘cate the cer-
tainty of the occurrence of a thing; so we might say, ‘ Ι 6111
there,’ in the sense of ‘ Ι will certainly go there. So here, ‘ by
the time you read this the consuls are made.’ He compares
Att. i. 20, 6, simul atque hoe nostrum hyemat . . . retard-
antur, which 1 do not think is at all el. In Att. v, 17, 1,
habebam, which, according to e isto usage, takes the lace
of habeo, assumes 6160 the fac ty 01“ the present to stan for
the future when certainty is to be ex ressed: paucis diebus
habebam certos homines=paueis diebus 'meseum- So in
Att. v. 7, proficiscebaoe=prqfodurus swm ,· Att. v. 20, 5, recepia-
bam=reoeptum sum ,· Att. vii„ 23, 2, remmobaan=rmisswm
nm ; faciebam =sact¹mus sum, next letter.

3. Oui rei fugerat me rescribere. ‘ Ι forgot to answer
one thing in your letter—about the brickwork. Ι beg you,
without any ualification (plane), to show your usual attentive-
11666 to my a aira, and about the aqueduct to show the same,
if anything ean be done about it! Μανία is ‘ Ι forgot ἐ cf.
suffit me ratio, Catull. 10, 29. Rei rescribere, ‘to answer a

oint in a letter,' would seem to be bad Latin if we had not ·

icero as authority for it: it arose out of the other not quite
accurate usage, ‘ Ι answered your letter,' instead of ‘ Ι answered
you,' or ‘ Ι answered what you asked me in your letter,' ame-
mmo-idianis tuis litteris heri statim resmpsi, nune respondeo
vespertinis, Att. xiii. 23, 1. [Is it not possible that rescribere
may have its mercantile sense here? ‘ Ae to a matter in
respect to which Ι forgot to make payment‚ Ι certainly beg you
to see to it,’ im. to provide the money.] The aqua seems to
have been the Aqua Crabra, which perhaps he thought of
bringing into Tusculanum (cf. Fam. xvi. 18, 3). Philippus
was the contractor, as we learn from the end of the next letter.
[cf. de aqua ‘nostra Tusculana, Balb. § 45. In Att. xv. 26, 4, I
believe Tusculano eapite should be read for Tulliano. The
mention of Cascellius (compared with Balb. 45) shows that the
