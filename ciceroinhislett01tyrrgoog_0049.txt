always held aloof‚ though we find him ever ready to lend
to a friend, and very frequently obliged to box-tow.¹ His
exile and its consequencee involved him in difficulties,
from which he never wholly emerged. Yet he cannot
have ever been deeply in debt, for we find him through-
out his life in possession of half a dozen country residences
in the most delightful parts of Italy, together with
‘ lodges,’ or deversoria, at Tarracina, Sinuessa, Gales,
and Anagnia, which the want of hotels rendered
necessary for persons of distinction who would travel in
a manner befitting their rank. In the matter of money
lent to him, Cicero shows 8 fastidious sense of honour
quite in edvance of his nge. He feels it incumbent on
him to apply to the repeyment of his debt to Caesar the
money which he had received for the expensos of his
triumph, ‘ because it looks ugly to be in debt to a. politicnl
opponent! 2 Again, on leaving Rome aster the death of

the charm of a woman’s sympathy ; but Caerellia never had resson
to regret that she hed extended it to him. In his respect for the

ἢ sanctity of domestic life Cicero presente a strong conti-ast to the

manners of his age. Other traits 111 1118 character, too, show nn
approximation to modern modes of feeling and thought—notably
his refined repugnance to the cruci sports of the amphitheatro.—

² Cicero walks under his lond of difficulties with 8 light step,
which reminds us of Sheridan, with whom, indeed, the reuma
conadam-is has other affinities. He says of his country houses st
Tusculum and Pompeii, me, illum ipsum veridicam aer-is alieni,
am non Corinthio sed Ιιοσ mmm-amo obruerunt (Att. ii. 1, 11);
and again (Fam. v. 6, 2), itaque nunc me wito tantum habero aer-is
alieni, ut cupiam coniurare, n· quis mo recipiat.
