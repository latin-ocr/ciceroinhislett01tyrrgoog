It would be impossible for me here to enter into an
elaborate comparison between the language of Cicero’s
letters and that of the comic stage. But in order to
show that the subject well deserves a full treatment, Ι

struck me. Ι will first take one play, the Miles Olor-icem,
and note the, coincidences3 then add such general re·
semblances as have not been touched.

(1) In the following examples it is not contended that
in every case the usage adduced is confincd to Cic. Epp.
and the comic drama; but that it 13 far more prevalent
there than elsewhere, and that this circumstance is not
fortuitous‚ but arises from the fact that the usage

- referred to partakes of that colloquial character which

the Germane call Vulqan'emuc.
