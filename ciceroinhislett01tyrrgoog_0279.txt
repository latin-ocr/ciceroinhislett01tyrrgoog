noras—XIII. (Arr. lv, 4b) 159

λόχον. ‘CerteS, you have truly bou ht a fine troop.’ It was
the habit of wealthy Romans to spec ate in troops of gladia-
tors, whom they let out or sold to the aediles for the public gemes
and to private individuals for other purposes: for instance, we
find, Q. Fr. ii. 4, 5, that Att. had sold a gang of roughs to
Cato. The reading of the mss‚ here is locum, which is quite
unintelligible. Att. had not bought any property near
Antium, so far as we know, and the reference here is plainly to
the troop of gladiators, of whom Cicero goes on to speak.
Loeum could not mean ⁶ the place where the ladiators were to
fight‚’ for that was always the public amphit eatre, and could
not be bought by Att. The usual reading is Ernesti’s conj.
ludum ‚· but 1 cannot find that this word ever signifies a troop
of gladiators ; it invariably denotes the school in which they
were trained. Now, it would be absurd that Cicero should con-
gratulate Att. on havin secured a good school, or training-
lace wherein they coul train for the forthcoming spectacles.
ff this is the meaning of the passage, we might as well retain
locum of the mss. I have accepted the conj. of Bosius:
λόχος would be a very natural term for a troop, samilw, of
gladiatore, and would appear in the msa. as locum, if written
in Latin characters, as Greek words very often are in the
letters. For instance, in this letter σιλλύβους appears as
sillabas and syllabos, and is in some edd. corrupted to syllabas.

pugnare mirifice. 1 hear they are fighting splendidly
(i.e. in practising for the games).

si . . . esses. ‘If you had chosen to hire tnem out
(already), you would have cleared your expensas by the two
aedilician spectacles given this ear.' Att. could not have
wanted the gladiatore, except to ire them out or to sell them.
We may suppose he did not think they were a's yet sufficiently
trained. Corradus, who would read myrta-ese, suggests that Att.
had given a munus in honour of his uncle, who died the year
before. Boot suspects, from the last words of Att. iv. 8 a,
that the gladiatore had not acquitted themselves well, and that
the words here should be taken ironically; but the words of
that letter do not justify his view.

liber. cf. ic„ liber ad te venio, Plin. Ep. iii. 9, 13.
Te liberasses is the ms. reading. Boot, retaining liberasses,
would (in pursuance of his theo about the ironical character
of the sentence) explain the wo as meaning ‘ you would have
given them all their freedom '3 that is, the would have

gougiht so · badly that they would all now be ‘ e among the
ea .
