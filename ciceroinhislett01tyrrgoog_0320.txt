Μ 112 Annio Saturnino. Probably a freedman of Τ. Annius
o.

satis dee, ‘ guarantee the purchaser against loss by flaws in
his title ' to some property which Cicero was selling3 or, if
Cicero was now bu ’ng some pro rty, satis dos must mean
‘give security for t 0 payment o the sum agreed on as the
price! The former meaning seems better suited to the sub-
sequent phrase satisdatio secwndum mancipium. He recom-
mends Atticus 1ο 1180 1110 satisdatio employed in the case of
the sale of the Mennian estate, adding, ‘ or perha 1 should
rather call it the Atilian property.' Cicero ro bly refers
10 8 former sale by him of some farms which e had bought
belonging to the estate of Mennim, wh0‚ he afterwards re·
members, had previously disposed of the lands to Atilius, so
that Atilius was reall the seller of the farms to Cicero.
[Rather veluti ., . . ve = ‘for example . . . or,’ vic. first one
example is given and 111011 811011101.]

3111110. The agent of Caesar, to whom Cicero owed 800, 000
ses 1008.

8901111811. Τ1118 verb is explained in the Dictt. as meaning
‘ to declare one’s wi ' 088 10 pay.’ But this sense is not
even alleged to be foun elsewhere, and it is very hard to see
how aperire 11000. could mean ‘ to deelare one's willingness to
pay ' that sum of money. The same is said to be the meaning
of womisti, ‘ you said the money was at his disposaL' Att. v.
4, 3. But there M. reads dc Doce„ which makes the meaning
easy. Hence here, 100, Ι 118νο added dc .· for aperire dc, ‘ to
explain‚’ of. Herenn. ii. 5o; and aperire de 11000. 18 a very
natural expression for ‘ 1ο explain the details of a transaction '
about 800,000 sesterces, Dc would have easily fallen out.
Cicero goes 011 10 say, ‘ Ι would willingly borrow to pay this
debt (versura sacta solvi volo) rather than keep Caesar waiting
until the last penny due to me is gotten in.’

3. transversum versiculum, ‘the crossing ’ of your letter,
written along the margin of the page.

admones de sorore. We may gather from the words at
the end of 5 4, haec . . . manendi, that Atticus had asked
Cicero to give his brother Quintus some advice about his
demeanour towards Pomponia.

Arpinas, sc. praedium&

dise, 80. festus. Arcanum was cn flitc, 80 Quintus thought it
was incumbent on him to stay there and entertain his tenants.
