reference to the praenomen as distinguished from the nomen or
,· and that quoted from Fam. i. 9, 19 is utterly
irrelevant, for Cicero does not even hint that it was by calling
Clodius Publius that the senators sought to flatter him3 the
int of the sa is wholly and solely that Clodius and
atinius both med 51θο praenomen Publiue. ² Again, it seems to
be very far-fetched to explain the Horatian passage by sup·
sing that the poet is thinking especially of the freedman
ama, who would be roud of the praenomen which he received
on his manumission. e context appears hardly to warrant this
sup sition. Now my explanation is very simple, and is quite

εὐτραπελία, ‘ graceful raillery.' Aristotle, Rhet. ii. 12, 16,
defines it as πεπαιδευμένη ὕβρις, capric railleur et vulin. St.
Paul warns the E hesians against it (v. 14), where the E. V.
translates the wordJ ‘ jesting.' ·

Sestiana. P. Sestius, whom Cicero defended, though a
man of eminent respectabilit and varied virtues (Sest. 6), did
not possess much grace of sty e or liveliness of wit. The severe
oold which Catullus caught from the s ech read by Sestius at
a dinner-party, in consequence of whic Catullus had to go to
. the country for change of air, forms a melancholy page of
history (Catull. 44). Pompeius on another occasion <At-t. vii.
17, 2) had to address a public letter to L. Caesar, and got
Sestius to write it—a. proceeding on which Cicero is very severe,
for whereas Pompeius had an admirable style, Sestius on this
occasion out-Sestiused himself (nihil wnquam leqi scriptum
σηστιωδέστερον).
