lviii CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

. the collections of Oicero's letters which we now possess.
He appears in the correspondence of Oicero as habitually
ailing. Cicero is constantly sending him prescriptions and ὗ
admonitions about preserving his health. He is said to have
lived to a hundred years of age. He set out for Cilicia with
Cicero when going to his province, but fell ill on the way,
and was left by Cicero with Lyso in Patrae in Achaia.

O. Cassius Longinus (Epp. lvi. lvii. Ixxviii.) is the
friend of Brutus and murderer of Julius Caesar. In 53
he was quaestor to Crassus in his campaign against the
Parthians, against whom he gained successes in 52 and
51. In 49 he was tribune of the plebs, and fled with
Pompeius from Rome. After the battle of Pharsalia he
surrendered to Caesar, who forgave him, and even pro-
mised him the province of Syria on his becoming praetor
in 44. But Cassius never could forgive Caesar, and was
the chief mover in the conspiracy which ended in his
murder. He slew himself on the field of battle at
Philippi in 42. He was married to the half-sister of
Brutus, and was a man of considerable cultivation, and a
follower of the philosophy of Epicurus.

ᾗ Servius Sulpicius (Epp. lx. lxi.) was an orator and

jurist3 quaestor, 7 4 3 curule aedile, 69 3 praetor, 65 3

ν consul with M. claudius Marcenus, 51. He embraced

Gaesar's cause in the civil war, and was made by Caesar

pro-consul of Achaia in 46. He died in 43 in the camp

of M. Antonius, who was besieging Dec. Brutus in

Mutina. No selection from the correspondence of Cicero

can omit his eloquent letter to Oicero (Ep. lx.) consoling
him on the occasion of his daughter's death.
