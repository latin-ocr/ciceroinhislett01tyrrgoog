LETTER XIV. (FAM. v· 12)

1. commis nerallyashere an adverb throughoutrepublican
and Augustam tin, and is used freely as a prep. only by
Tacitus. There ere only two passe in Cic. where coram (aee.
to the mse.) is a prep. One is ' . 12, mihi vero ipsi coram
aomo meo, which is simffl emended by Dr. Reid, who inserts
et before qenero, thus ma. ‘ g eoram an adverb es usual. The
other is Fam. xiii. 6 a, 1, me et coram P. Guspio tecum locutum
esse, where we should probably read me et eoram ewm P. Cuspio
et tecam locutum esse. [There are exx. of the prep. usage in
Livy, as in xxxv. 49, 1. Plautus and Terence seem to be the
only writers who nse the word before Cic. Ennius has not the
word, nor Lucilius, nor Catullus, nor (I think) Lueretius. We
find an ex. of the prep. use in Hor. A. P. 185, coram populo
Medea trucido& also in Sat. i. 4, 74 end 953 Ep. i. 17, 433
I have not noted a certain ex. in Ovid.] ·

for himself a place in his history.
