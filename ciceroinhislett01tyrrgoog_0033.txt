'l'he ruin of Pompeius drew Cicero closer to him than his
most splendid triumphs. Cato was not the only Roman
in whose eyes the vuuquished found more favour than the

'l'he attitude of Cicero towards Caesar on the one
hand, and Pompeius on the other, before the outbreak
of the civil war, has been largely misropresenoed. It has
been urged that Cicero did not really believe in Pompeius
as the champion of the Republi03 that he knew that
Pompeius was only using the Constitutiou as a peg on
which to hang his personui protensions3 in short, that
what both rivale were aiming at was one and the same
thing—a tyrannis. It is true that there are many ex-
pressions in his letters which would seem to support this
theory, but we must remember that we have in these
letters (and this is what gives them their profound
interest) the private and unstudied record of every
passing phase in the mind of one whose liter-ary genius
enables him ιο stereotype each ffitting smile or sigh in
some matchlessly expressive and subtile phrase. Thus
the correspondence of Oicero supplies us with apt texts
in support of almost every conceivable theory of his
character and principles. As once was said about the
Holy Scriptures—
