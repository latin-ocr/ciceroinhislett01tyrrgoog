xliv CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

It is in his daughter Tullia that Oicero finds his solaco
and pride. Like Francis Atterbury, he found in the
society of a daughter his one refuge from tho changes and
chauces of a troublous life. He is never wear-ied of
recounting her virtues, Indeed‚ he so eulogises her
intellectual powers and her acquired knowledge, that ho
has almost earned for her the unenviable reputation of an
apr-it fort, or even a blue-stocking. Her infatuation for
Dolabella, her third husband, is quite consistent with her
father's account of her. We often find women of really
exceptional intellect yielding to the fascinatione of a
handsome‚ shallow, somewhat elever Bohemian. Such
was the blind admiration which the Bronte sistere felt
for their ποί-1111668 brother3 such was the love of Georgo
Eliot'e Romola for Τίτος and such was the strange
infatuation which made Tullia cling to Dolabella, in
spite of his wicked extravagance, which equandered her
dower‚ and his insulting infidelities with Caecilia Metella,
which he hardly took the trouble to conceal. Tullia had
lost her first husband, the noble Piso, by death3 she
was then married to Crassipes» It was when her father
was absent in cilicia that her hand was sought for the
third time. Among her euitors was Tiberius Nero, the
father of the Emperor. Tullia died in childbirth) at the
age of 31, at her father's house in Tusculum, where
she had taken refuge from the outrages of DolabeUa.

received her into his house, in spite of the girl's earnest
