lectiunculis, ‘ little dips into books.’ This 18, 1 think,
what Cicero wrote. He 11811 88111 above (or implied) that the
leisure of Marius was not pro rly em loyed unless he did
something useful. Nous, 18 8 little ’ps into books would
be very useful as com red with dozing over bad farees. Κ1.
conjectured spectiuncu is for lectiunculis; but would taking ‘little
peeps ¹ at the 1188111188 of the Bay of Naples satisfy the condition
expressed above, modom tibi eonstiteritsmwtus otii tui? Moreover,
spectarem 18 just the word that would ‘not be used after spatiun-
eulis. But the editors have treated 11118 p 8 very badly:
in the words mque dubito quin tu ex illo cubica ο ex quo tibi
scammum perforasti . . . per 888 dies matutina tempora
lectiunculis comtempseris, it 8881118 81 first sight that for ex illo
cubiculo we should certainly read in illo maculo, and this 1188
118811 1118 8811188 adopted by every editor from Lallemand to
Baiter. But this 18 unseientific. If Cicero wrote the easy in
illo cubiculo, 1711 118 811 1118 11188. give us the difficult a
illo cubiculo? T 8 fact 18, 11181 111 em illo cubiculo a quo 178
have an example of that inverso attraction, which is quite 111
the manner of Plautus, with 1711888 diction 1 have already
pointed out 88 many marked parallelisms in the Letters of
Cicero: cf„ for instance, Pl. cist. i. 1, 63, indidem unde ονίιιιν
facito ut facias stultitiam sepelibile‘m ; again, eqo te hodie reddam
madidum si vivo probe tibi quoi decretum est bibero aquam, Aul.
iii. 6, 393 quid illum facere vis qui, tibi quoi divitiae domi
nwaewmae seem . . . ‘ramnum nullum habes, Epid. iii. 1, 8.
Η81188 Ι would by no means change ex illo to in illo, with
Lallemand. Such a course would be truly ‘ from the purpose ’ of
criticism. Either Cicero wrote ar illo . . . lectiunculi& or eae
illo . . . spediunculis ; certainly not in illo . . . lectitamus.
