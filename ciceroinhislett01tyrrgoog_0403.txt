instrumenti, ‘ outfit.'
IumentO, ‘ an equipage.’

animadvertes, ‘you will see to be the case.⁹ The ms.
gives animadvertis, but this must be corrected to απύπιαώυενεσε
or asm‘mwdvemkti. The former seems the easier remedy.

LETTER LX. (ΕΔΜ. IV. 5)

1. sane quam. This coupling of quwm with adverbs is
very common in the lette'rs.

pro eo ac debu-i, ‘ 1 deplored it as bitterly as 1 was bound.’
istic. In Italy, where Cic. was.

genus hoc consolationis, ‘ consolation of every kind,' ‘ con-
solation in the abstract,’ ‘ consolation per 80 ' ; this is a common
use of ymas. In Fam. v. 12, 1 qenus tum-wm scriptorum means
‘your work as a whole‚’ and in Fam. vii. 23, 2 ymas ommium

confieri„ Cic. uses confici. Another correspondent, Balbus

callere, ‘ to be callous) In Cic. this word means ‘ to be
thoro-uffihly conversant with! βοηωῑῑωοενσ is ‘ to be callous.’
[1 thm callere means ‘ to be wise or ‘ to be sensible. J

3. cedo, I have corrected credo to cedo. The mss. give an
illius vicem, cred0, doles, where an and credo cannot stand to-
gether. Hofm. changes an to at. Munro would correct credo to
Cicero. Far better in my mind is the change of credo to cedo,
which often means ‘ tell me ’ in the comic drama and in cie„
both in his letters and in his other works. Cedo is used exactly
as here, ‘ pray,’ parenthetically‚ by Cato ap. Quintil. ix· 2, 21,
