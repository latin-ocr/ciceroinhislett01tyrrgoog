xxvi CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

Hic liber est in quo quaerit sua dogmata quisquc,
Invenit et pariter dogmata quisque sua.

This being eo, it is unfair to set against the prevailing
tone of his letters the hasty expression of a momentary
sear, the severish outburst of distracted petulance.
Cicero does speak of Pompeius as being, like Caesar,
actuated only by personal motives‚ but it is in the tone
in which many a good Tory often said of Beaconsfield,
‘ I declare he is as bad as Gladetone! -A full and fair
examinationes the letters shows that he did regard
Pompeius as the champion of the Republic, and Caesar
ae its declared foe. I propose, therefore, by means of
quotations from the lettere, to summarise as briefly ae
possible the evidence afforded by the letters for the settle-
ment of this question.

I. Oicero did not look on neutrality ae at all a
possible course for a man of honour.

Quid ergo, inquiS, acturus es? idem quod pecudes», quae dis-
pulsae sui generis secuntur greges: ut bos armenta, sic ego
bonos vii-oe, aut eos quicunque dicentur boni, sequar, etiam si
ruent. (Att. vii. 7, 7.)

Si erit bellum, cum Pompeio esse constitui. (Att. vi-i.
26, 3.)

(Depugnabo) cum bona quidem spe vel vincendi vel in liber-
tate moriendi. (Att. vii. 9, 4.)

Si enim castris res geretur, video cum altero vinci satius esse
quam cum altero vincere. (Att. vii. 1, 4.)

Sin bellum geretur non deero officio neo dignitati meae.
(Att. vii. 17, 4.)

Sive enim ad concordiam res adduci potest sive ad bonorum
victoriam, utriusvis r‘ei me aut adiutorem velim esse, aut certe

mm mertem. (Att. vii. 1, 2.)
