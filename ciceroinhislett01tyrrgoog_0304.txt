Iovis Hospitalis, Ζεὺς Ξένιος. We must infer that certain
Greeks had been instrumental in bringing about a reconcilia-
tion between Cicero and A pius. If he broke with Appius he
would offend these Grec , and so the god who ‘ protecte
them.’ Moreover, Iupiter Hospitalis would be the protector of
these strangers in Rome.

magis optandum. Caesar writes to Balbus that he could
see that Balbus had said something about Quintus Cicero in
his letter ; that he could not make out the meaning3 that, if
his ess at the meaning was right, it announced a fact which
he ffim) might wish, but hardly hope, to be true. The
announcement was probably that Quintus had determined to
transfer his services from Pompeius to Caesar. Nothing could
be more courteous than Caesar s wey of receiving this news.

5. Locum. 1 cannot understand why the editors should
agree in chan ” g the ms. locwm to iocum. There is not s
particle of evi ence that Caesar’s letter was playful: the little
extract we have from it here is full of dignified courtesy. The
‘ e about his poverty,’ locum illius de sua westan, was
no doubt in the same strain. He said with regret that he
could not promise Quintus an El Dorado in his camp. Cicero
advises his brother not to look with disfavour on that
—not to let it deter him from joining Caesar—and te him
that in reply he has let Caesar know how or they were—how
he (Caesar) ‘ must not get himself into d· culties through any
reliance on his (Cicero’s) resources.'

Quamquam. ‘ Yet‚' though I promise you a regular diury.
