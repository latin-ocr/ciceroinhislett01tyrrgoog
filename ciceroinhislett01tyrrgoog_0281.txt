the use of vel as distinguishe from aut and seu or sive.

What Cicero preferred was that Lucceius should publish a

fuga redituque. But Themistocles did not return. Yet
this cannot be a μνημονικὸν ἁμάρτημα of Cicer0, though such are
not rare. (In Div. ii. 63 there is a remarkable laps-as memoriae,
even Agamemno for Ulioees.) For Cicero, in other places (ey. Brut.
43; Att. ix. 10, 3; Lael. 42), dwells on the fact that Themis-
tocles did not return after his exile. It is quite impossible that
in the word reditu Cicero refers to the fact that Themistocles
was brought back to Athens after his death, and secretly buried
there, though this is referred to in the passage above quoted
from the Brutus. It has therefore been proposed to read
Alcibiadi for Themistocli. Perhaps what Clcero really wrote
waS, Diemisioclifuqa‚ Coriolani fuya redituque. But he seems to
be referring here only to Greek notables. In two, however, of the
laces quoted above (Att. ix. 10, 3, and Lael. 42) he couples
{hemistocles and Coriolanus. If the copyist, having written
Themistocli fuya, happened to raise his eyes from his task, he
would mentally note that he was to resume it after the word
