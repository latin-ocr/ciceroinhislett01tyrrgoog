xx CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

he proposes a law enacting that any one -who had put
Roman citizens to death without trial should be inter-
dicted from fire and water. Caesar having in vain tried
to gain Cicero as an adherent—having in vain sought
even to afford him an opportunity for retiring from a
perilous position with honour—now abandons him to his
fate. Indeed Cicero’s presence in Rome as a declared
opponent of the Triumvirate might have proved an
obstacle to his own departure for Gaul. Pompeius
betrayed him to whom he had so often pledged his word.
The treason of Pompeius and the jealousy of Hortensius
wellnigh cost the world some of the noblest of the
speeches and essays of Cicer-0, ·for often during his exile
the victim of Clodius was on the point of sels-destruction.
He often regrets that he had not opposed force to force,
even though he should have perished in the employment
of it3 and still more he deplores the fatal step which he
took in leaving Rome before he was directly impeached.

- But he invariably attributes his fau—first, to the

treason of Pompeius against the Optimates‚ and conse-
quently against himself3 secondly‚ to the jealousy felt
towards him by the rival aspirants to the leadership of
the Optimate party.

The recall of Cicero cannot be ascribed to a sudden
rapprockement on the part of Pompeius to the nobility.
Nor is it true to the authorities to say that the terms on
which the nobility accepted the overtures of Pompeius
were the re-establishment of the senatorial government
and the recall of Cicer-0. The exile of Cicero was due to 5
the jealousy of the nobility as much as to the treason of 5
