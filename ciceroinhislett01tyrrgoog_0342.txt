this form was dispensed with. G‘ieero Attico Sal„ as a heading
to each letter to Atticus, is probably not genuine, for Cicero
never uses the name Attice in the body of a letter until we
come to the year ΒΛ). 50 (Att. vi. 1, 20). Mi Pomponi is the
nearly invariable form of address, even after the year Re.
65, before which he must have received his sui-name Atticus ;
therefore it is not probable that this sui-name was used all along
by Cicero in the hesdinge of his letters and nowhere else.

It has been observed that Cicero ve rarely introduces the
names of his correspondents into his etters. In the whole
of the sixteen books to Atticus, containing 397 letters, he apo·
strophises his friend by name only twenty-two times. Such
apostro hes are very much more frequent in the Brutine eor-
{2⁸3ss ⁰¹4⁰ssss 3235} Ἧῗὲῥξξὲἓξ {3313 2³1?ss {33:35ssssssssss
of the Brutine correspondenee.

Cicero occasionally calls Atticus mi Attice (vi. 1, 20 3 xiv.
12, 1) ; sometimeS‚ but ve rarely, mi Tite (ix. 6, 5) and mi
Τ. Pomponi (iv. 2, 5). In edicating the De Senectute to him
he writes Ο ΤΙΤΕ; but in this passage he is quoting from
Ennius. Cicero addresses Trebatius as mi stebati, mi Testa,
Testa mi, and in one place as mi vetule (Fam. vii. 16, 1). He
calls him 0. Trebati 111 Top. i. 1, as he is dedicating his work
to Trebatius3 but to address his friend thus in a letter would
be stiff and formal. The omission of the praenomen was a mark
of close intimae in the time of cicere, as is distinctly proved in
this letter by the words quod sine praenomine familiariter, -ut
debebas, ad me qristolam misisti, primwm addubitavi num a
Volmnnio senatore esset, quomam mihi est maynus uem. Com-

re also Fam. xvi. 18, 1, where Cicero addresses a letter to

‘ ο with the greeting Tullius Tironi Sall, and Tiro seems te
have taken exce tion to the form as unsuited to their respective
positione. Wo which indicated close familiarity were scarcely
suitable between Cicero and a manumitted slave. Cicero in
reply suggests even a more familiar form of address— Quid
etiam ? non sie oportet ? equidem censeo sie: addendum etiam
Suo? But he adds, sed si placet invidia fitetur. The omission
of the praenomen would have provoked unfavourable comment.
This is probably the real interpretation of Hor. Sat. ii. 5, 32 ι
Qtemie, puta, aut Publi, gaudent praenomine molles Aurio-ulae.
Punctilious Romans wished to be addressed with distant and
formal respect. The places which Orelli cites in su port of his
view, which is the contradictory of mine (as he hol without
evidence, that the use of the praenomen was a mark of intimacy),
are not relevant. The passage from the De Pet. Cons. has no
