lxx CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

most valuable is that they were not (like the letters of
Pliny, and Seneca, and Madame de Sevigne) written to
be published. The letters are absolutely trustworthy3
they set forth the failures and foibles of their writer as
well as his virtues and his triumphs. The portraits with
which they abound were never to be shown to his in-
voluntary sitters, so there was no reason why they should
” not be faithful. In his speeches this is not so: according
to the requirements of his brief, his subject-s are glorified
or caricatured beyond recognition.

As a motto for the whole correspondence may be taken
his own words 1 in which he exalts the letter of Atticus
over the oral description of Cur-10. He should be a good
talker who could surpass the vivacity of Cicero's letters.
But it is a serious error to ascribe carelessness to them.
His style is colloquial, but thoroughly accurate. Cicero
is the most precise of writers. Every sentence corre-
sponds to a definite thought, and each word gives its aid
to the adequate expression of the whole. Those who
think that the speeches are 'a mere effusion of rhetoric, a
piling up of superlatives for most of which another super-
lative might easily be substituted without any injury to
the meaning or effect of the passage, have (it seems to
me) not read Cicero aright. Every adjective is set down
. with as careful a pen as ever was plied by a master-

letters have not this quality. For an instance of the degree to
which Cicero disguises his real feelings in his public letters see
Att. xiv. 1321, where he sends to Atticus a copy of a letter te
Antonius·
