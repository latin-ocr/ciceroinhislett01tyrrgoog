He breaks off with the· reflection‚ ‘ It would take a lon time

asso sole. In his Brutus Cic. introduced Atticus as one of
the interlocutors in the discussion about distinguished orators
held in pratulo propter Platonis statuam (Brut. 24). Att. had
a far higher opinion of that treatise than Cic. himself enter-
tained. Now 1f we may assume that Cic. thou ht of giving
Att- a place among the s kers in the De Fini us he mi ht
very well have written ere words which would playflfily
express the sentiment that he would put into the mouth of
Att. in the projeeted dialogus far more ornate and elegant
language than that with which he had furnished him in the
Brutus. He calls the whole dialogus ‘ a basking ’ (sole) because
it was held in pratulo, and he writes, ‘ Instead of that dry
basking in the meadow we shall call on you for one full of
unguente and all sorts of brilliancy.' Then he returns to the
subject of Tyrannio’s book on aecents. He did introduce Att. ,
into De Fin. v.‚ but did not give him much to say. In Att.
xiii. 12, 3, he calls the De Fin. περὶ τελῶν σύνταξιν, and writes,
Bruto ut tibi placuit daspmtdimus. Perhaps Att. requested
Cic. not to give him an im rtant place among the characters
in the dialogue. [τέλος. feel sure there is no allusion to the
De Finibus. The word τέλος is to be explained by tua sunt

obtain knowledge. But is any real knowledge to be gained
from a work on so trivial a subject as that of accentuation'3 It
would take lon to discuss the point, as Att. is so delighted
with Tyrannio’sgbook. The sentence E‘c pro isto . . . repetemus
is to be explained by the one preceding. Its general drift is,
‘ I shall be getting a much greater boon from you (in the great
attention you are giving to my affairs 3 cf. the last sentence of
Att. xii. 5, 2, te quidem . . . immota) than the boon Ι confer-red
