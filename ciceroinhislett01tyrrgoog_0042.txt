xxxiv ‘CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

lous serenity' Mommsen dwells so lovingly‚ could send
such a letter to the senate as veni, vidi, vici. With
what ridicule would such a despatch now be received by
Parliament and the Press. Cicero lived in an epoch
when pro-consuls sought and found their ‘ laurels in a
must cake,' and on their return to Rome enjoyed the
empty pageantry of a triumph or a eumolicatio, which
was often but a mockery of their demonstrated incom-
petence. But, in spite of characteristic weaknesses,
Cicero was a great power in his age. In the opinion
of his contemporaries he saved Rome in the time of
Catiline, and did his best to save it in the time of
Antonius. When once fairly embarked 'in politics, Cicero
was eminently serviceable to the party of his adoption.
For these services he has been condemned byMommsen,
but has won the enthusiastic praise of Pliny, who rightly
sees the splendid triumphs of a born orator, not the en-
forced drudgery of a slighted hireling, in the speeches
which persuaded the people to abandon the Agrarian
Law, ‘ that is, their food,’1 and to spare Roscius 3 and
which induced the descendants of the Sullan proscripts
to relinquish their claim to office. It was the same
magio power which extorted from the iudices the con-
demnation of Verres, and which sent Catilina half
stunned from the. Senate. It would be very easy to
add to Pliny a long array of enthusiastic admirers of
Cicero among ancient writers. 'l'he eloquent eulogy of
Velleius Paterculus (ii. 66) has often been quoted, and
Quintilian (Inst, Or. xii. 1, 15) has given a noble testi·
