Ivi CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

Lucceius tc deal separately with the history of his own
life from his consulship to his recall from exile. Lucceius
promised to comply‚ but seems never to have carried out
his design. In 49 he embraced the cause of Pompeius,
and was subsequently pardoned by Caesar and allowed
to live in Rome, where 116 enjoyed the society of 010610.

For Μ. Marius (Ep. xvii.) Cicero expresses the
highest admiration and esteem (Q. Fr. ii. 8, 2). Η6
was very delicate, and of the most refined tastes and
habits.

0. Trebatius Testa (Epp: xxii-xxv. lxxix.), a Roman
jurist of great eminence, was an intimate friend of 016610,
who recommended him to Caesar when on his Gallie
campaigns. He followed Gaesar’s party when the civil
war broke out. Cicero dedicated to him his Topica,
and Horace addressed to him the first Satire of the
second book. He is often cited- as an authority in the
Digest, but not even fragments of his books De iure civili
ι and De religionibus survive. He was an Epicurean, and
was tribune in 47. “

Μ. Caelius Rufus (Epp. xxvii. xxxi. ), a young noble of
great promise, preserved the friendship of Cicero in spite
of the profligacy of his life. He was distinguished for

his eloquence, and his letters show great vivacity of '

intellect. He was the lover of Clodia, the enemy of
010610, the belle dame sans merci who has been identified
with the Lesbia of Catullus. He was quaestor in 57,
and was prosecuted in 56 on the charge of having
horrowed money from Clodia to procure the death of
Dion, the head of the embassy sent by Ptolemy Auletes
