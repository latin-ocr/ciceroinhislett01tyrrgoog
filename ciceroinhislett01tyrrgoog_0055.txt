INTRODUGTION xlvii

mother. of the former he writes (De Or. ii. 1) as quami
ac ⁰ simi voh-i, and there is good reason to think
that the beginning of his poem on his consulship was
devoted to an elaborate eulogy of his father.¹ Oicero has
often been aecused of want of filial feeling, became he has
been supposed to have curtly announced the death of his
father to Atticus in the words pater nobis decessit a. d.
iiii. Kal. Decembris (Att. i. 6, 2 ; Ep. iii.) In my notes
on that passage I. have fully discussed the soundness of
the text. It is enough here to observe that even if the
text be mund, it is quite probable that Oicero had
announeed to Atticus in more fitting terms his father’s
death, and is here (in answer ιο a question from Atticus)
merely reminding his friend of the date—‘ the date of my
poor father’s death (for this is the force of nobis) was
Nov. 2⁷3 ⁸

While acquitting Oicero in this particular instance,
one cannot help noticing, even in the most refined of the
ancient Romans, an absence of sensibilities which polish,
and even sweeten‚ the intercourse of modern life. In
Att. i. 3 Cicero announces to Atticus the death of the
grandmother of Atticus in jesting phrase, which good
taste must condemn. It seems that the lady was not
dear to Atticus, and that he was not at all likely to
feel real grief for her3 yet there is certainly a coarse-
uess of tone in the letter. A sentiment of reverence

² See note on Att. i. 19, 10, in Come-spondeum of Cicero.

² For strong expressions of real sorrow for the death of a slave,
and again, of a mere acquaintance, we have to go no farther than
Att. i. 12, 4, and iv. 6, 1.
