Ulubrano, In CIL. x. 6489 (= Or. 123) we find a duovir et
quaestor reip. at Ulubrae, and in 6490 (= Or. 121, 4942) a
praefi iuri dicundo. Ulubrae was accordingly a mumicipiwm.

hatius was patronus of the town. These patroni were influen-
tial Romans, selected by the demeriortea who used to lend assist-
ance and protection to the town at Rome. The townsmen then
were their clientes. The patroni were put first in the list of
the senate (see the album of Canusium, CIL: ix. 338). For

1. arbitrare. The reading of M„ acce ted by all the editore,
is arbitrarere. But it seems to me that t ' is probably wrong.
Arbitrarere was, by one of the commonest of errore, assimilated
to the mood of viderere. Now the Codex Turonensis has arbi·
trare, which seems to me to be more probably right. It is true

while Cicero, in my judgment‚ wrote viderere . . . arbitrare.
For what satisfactory meaning could be got out of arbitrarere ἵ

Because Trebatius seemed to Cicero wanting in 1118111688, and
impatient? But would Cicero be annoyed with Trebatius
