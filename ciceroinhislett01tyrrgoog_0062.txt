liv CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

was about to give, Cicero adds: ‘ but give them a
- decent entertainment, an you love me, else -they will
vent on my treatise their indignation against you?
Nepos (Vit. Att. 13) says that he knows as a fact that
the amount allowed by Atticus for household expenses
was 3000 asses, οι· about six guineas of our money,
a-month.

Nothing seemed more important to Atticus than to
conceal as much as possible his business relations, and to
appear before the world as a literar-y gentleman living on
his estates in Epirus and elsewhere. When we find that
his uncle, the odious Caecilius, from whom Cicero tells us
even his own relations could not get a sarthing under
twelve per cent, adopted Atticus, and left him heir to a
large fortune, one is a little tempted to think that the
usurer Caecilius was in reality a secret partner of Atticus,
taking much of the profits and all the obloquy‚ and not
unwilling on those terms to play J orkins to the Spenloe
of his influential nephew.

One cannot much admire the character of the man who
was on terms of intimate friendship with Clodius during
his persecution of Cicer0, and wh0, after the· murder of
Cicero, was the friend and entertainer of Fulvia, the
wife of Antonius. His knowledge 'of business was, no
doubt, of much service to Cicero; but we find that
Cicero even here was able to repay him in kind. The
very last letter of Cicero to Atticus 1 shows the keen
interest which Cicero took in the material intel-ests of
his friend.
