lxxxii CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

tinae, sed ita tamen ut nihil minus velim quam Pom-
poniam versari in timore ruinae, ‘ I greatly value the
enjoyment of my palaestra on the Palatine, not, how-
ever, so much as to prevent my feeling that anything is
better than to keep Pomponia in constant fear of the
falling of the wall.' There are other good instances in
Att. ii. 21, 13 ii. 24, 25 iii. 15, 2 ; and in the letter of
Quintus, De petitione consulatus, 5 13.

(3) Caution often compels Cicero to use covert language
when dealing with dangerous topics. Hence the enig-
matic Greek in which he refers to the dishonesty of
Philotimus in some letters of the eth book to Atticae.
This cantion has left its impression on the diction of the
letters in the use of the plural when only one person is
meant, e.g. veteres hostes novos amicos in referring to

, Caesar, Fam. v. 7, l ; and in Att. i. 17, 3, meos means

Quintus, tuos Pomponia3 invidorum refers to Hortensius
in Att. iii. 7, 2. ’ So Pompeius is often referred to by a
plural attribute. Somewhat like this is the pluralis
modestiae (as Draeger calls it, Hist. Synt. i. 25), whereby
a man speaking of himself in a somewhat boastful tone
sostens the arrogance by the use of, the plural: see
Fam. v. 4, 22 again, in that same letter tuorum
refers to Clodius alone, but is made plural invidiae
minuendae causa.

(4) The use of epistolary tenses is familiar to readers
of the letters, and is commented on in the notes. For
the emphatic eqo pointing to the fact that the sentence

in which it occurs is an answer to a question, see ἐζ
viii. ἓ l. .
