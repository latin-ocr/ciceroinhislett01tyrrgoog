INTRODUOTION li

the violence of his expressions 1 makes us feel that in his
tragedies he must have ‘ torn the passion to tatters ’ ε in
his province he is a wild beast in ferocity, though he
seems to have sought to be just, and he certainly was
not rapacious53 he returned from Asia as poor as he left
Rome; but woe to the luckless provincial who was
caught tripping3 the scourge was not cruel enough for
Quintus, nor the axe' sufficiently expeditious. Not
Shakspere's Richard was more ready to cry ‘ Off with his
head 1 ’ ² But in private life he was the humblest of men.
Haec eqo patior cotidie is his plaintive ejaculation
when Pomponia insults him in presence of his brother
Marcus, and refuses to sit at table because Quintus
had sent his slave Statius on before to see if dinner
were ready (Ep. xxvi.) No doubt the undue influence
accorded to Statius in domestic matters was resented
by the mistress of the household3 but the paramount
position of that slave seems to show that (in his private
life), had Quintus been emancipated from the tyranny of
Pomponia, he would have experienced but a change of
rulers. The letters of Marcus are full of affection
towards his brother Quintus. Nor does he fail in solici-
tude for him and his son even after he has discovered

² Cicero, writing to Atticus (xv. 29, 2), says of Quintus, eqo
tamen suspicim- hwnc, υτ sonu, alucinari .· for examples of the
violence of Quintus, see Q. Fr. i. 2, 6.

² I write ‘ Shakspere’s Richard ’ advisedly. Shakspere's
Richard more than once eries ‘ off with his head 1⁹ 'Phe oft-quoted

Shakspere, but from Colley Cibber.
