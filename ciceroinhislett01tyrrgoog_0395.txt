3. baro, It appears that the ‘ pedant ’ Dion (a term which
seems to have been often ap lied to Epicureans) desired to
know whether any one had a {notty 1²fioint (ζήτημα) to propose
for solution, end put his nera-l ch enge of the com ny in

understood before ‘ cena nwm quid ad te Ρ ’ end that understood
