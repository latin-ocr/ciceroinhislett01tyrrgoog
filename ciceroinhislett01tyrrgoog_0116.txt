APPENDIX ΤΟ INTRODUGTION

DINERS OUT

Am, great cities abeund with little men, whose object it is to
be stars of the dinner·table, and grand purveyors of all the
stray jokes of the town. So long as these confine themselves to
seteh and carry for their masters they succeed tolerably well,
but the moment they set up for originality, and turn manufac-
turers instead of retailers, they are ruined. Like the hind
wheel of the carriage which is in constant pursuit of the fore
without ever overtaking it; so these become the doubles of a
Selwyn or a Sheridan, but without ever coming up to them.
They are constantly near wit without being witty, as his valet
is always near a great man without being great.

A MOTLEY OREW

BUT with every care the camp still presented an irregular and
uncouth appearance. A spy who was sent from England about
the middle os October reports as follows z—They consist of an
odd medley of grey beards and no beards—-old men fit to drop
into the grave, and young boys whose swerds are near equal to
their weight, and I really believe more than their length.
Four or five thousand may be very good determined men, but
the rest are mean, dirty, villainous-looking rascals, who seem
more anxious for plunder than their prince, and would be better
pleased with four shillings than a crown.
