be natural that the senate should refuse to datach from the

rovince of Syria a town so situated. [There is good reason to
· elieve that Euphrati is the only form of the gen. which Cic.
would have used. Of. Madv. on Fin. i. ᾖ 14 and on v. ἕ 12.
The evidence is of course much more extensive than what is
given in those notes.]

in the passage. Unless the jo {Glires in some myon to Uise
unknown tetrarch or rinceling of Bozra, whom (Cicero says)
the Roman nobles wo d not endure to see clad in the Roman
robe of state, 1 see no joke in the passage, except that Cicero

affecte to condemn a decree of the senate to refurbish his ⁸

robe, to save the King the expense of redyeing it every
year. There would be more humour in the words of Cicero 1f
renovari could mean, ‘ to be put on a new footing.’ Thus
Cicero would say, ‘ as regards his petition to have his distinc-
tion put on a new soot‘e'snq (im. ‘ven to him absolutely without “
the necessi of yearly renewa ), to save himself the ex nse of
a yearly re yeing (ia. a yearly embassy to Rome to so 'cit re-
newal)‚ I am against such a decreess The same sense would be
got by reading with Lamb. and Eur: quod non vult renovari
honores eosdem, ‘ as to his request not to have a renewal of his
distinction on the same terms,’ that is, ‘ not to have it renewed
for a' year, but in perpetui .’ This is the reading which
Wieland translates, and is per aps the most probable solution
of the difficulty, though it is very darin to insert non. We

can hardly hoza to get any nearer to tffie meaning without “
knowing somet in of ⁶ the Bozran.’ Bostra, the Bozra of
. Isaiah, was a consi erable town in Arabia Petraea. [It may be
that when Caes. in his consulship gave this man the right of
wearing the toya praetexta, he merely gave him the honorary
rank of a Roman magistrate for the year, and his right of
wearing the coya would ex ire with the year, as in the case of
the Roman magistrates, e now begged to have the grant
renewed. The clause quo minus, etc.‚ must surely be de-
pendent on decmaendum camec, not on quod vult, etc.‚ unless
non vult is written. The text may construe thus: I make no
proposal such as would prevent him from furbishing hisotoqa
