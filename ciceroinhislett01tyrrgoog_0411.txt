the case of P. Sestius ’ ; the jury were said ire im eonsilvhmt, and
the president mittere iudices in cmwilium.

unctorem. The Greek form aliptes or alipta is commoner
than the Latin3 see Fam. i. 9, 15.

Sardos venales. After the conquest of Sardinia by Ti.
Sempronius Gracchus in 177, Sardinian slaves became a drug
in the market. The were of a very poor physique, owin no
doubt to the unhealt 'ness of their native climate. The orm
of the proverb was—-

Sardi venales : alim alio mmor,
‘A job-lot of Sardiniam, one worse than the othon·

salaconis, ‘snob,’ ‘ swaggerer.’
iniqmtatem, ‘ unfairness, ' ‘ unreasonableness. '

Catonem tuum. cf. Mommsen, R. H. iv. 449, on the litera·
ture of (latos b the republicans: ‘ The republican opposition
horrowed from ato its whole attitude, stately‚ transcendental
in its doctrine, pretentiously rig-id, hopeless, and faithful to
death3 and accordingly it began even immediately after his
death to revere as a saint the man who in his lifetime was often
its laughing-stock and its scandal.’x We find Brutus, Cicero,
and Gallus writing Cato-⁴1, and Caesar and Hirtius countering
with anti - Catus. The subject could be easily handled in
rhetorical fashion from either point of view.

LETTER LXIV. (FAx. v11. 25)

1. conscissam. This probably refers to theNusfletter, in
which Cic. had written severely about Tigellius. Fadius Gallus
had torn it up, through sear lest it mi ht compromise Cicero,
for Tigellius enjoyed great influence wi51 Caesar. Cic. assures
him that he has a copy. From this we ma infer that Cic.
kept copies of some (perha s most) of his etters, and this
accounts for the very consi erable correspondence which Tiro

was able to collect.

ne si istum. The reading of the mss. is vereri nisi asima
habaet-anus ; now vereri must be followed b ne, so it is pretty
certain that for nisi should stand m si. e sense then will
demand after istum some word like iratwm or &nse-stum, or
rather &aseneum (since &nfestwm habere means in Cic. infestare,
‘to keep in a state of turbulence’3 see Att. ix. 19, 33 16, 8).
