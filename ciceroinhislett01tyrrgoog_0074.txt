lxvi CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

selected for praise the very best bits, which were now
enhanced in his own estimation by the approval of his
friend3 ‘ for,’ he writes, ‘ Ι was in great dread of those
bits of red wax of yours' 1 which pointed out defects.
The most important testimony in support of Nake's view
is a passage in Att. ii. 1, 2, tu si tibi placuerit liber
curabis ut et Athenis sit et in ceteris oppidis Graeciae,
which shows clearly that Atticus was in the habit of
actually publishing works of Cicero, the book here re-
ferred to being a memoir of his consulship, written in
Greek. However, all these arguments do not in my
opinion counterbalance the evidence for the editorship
of Tiro, given above, and to it may be added a passage
in Fam. xvi. 23, 2, where Oicer0, writing to Tiro, says,
Atticus noster, quia quondam me commoveri πανι κοῖς
intellexit, idem semper putat, nec videt quibus praesidiis
philosophiae saeptus sim, et hercle quod timidus ipse est,
θορυβοποιεῑ. Surely this contemptuous judgment 011
himself would not have been permitted by Atticus to
¹ survive in his edition. Moreover, the only obJection
against the theory that Tiro was the editor is the defec-
tive arrangement of the books above referred t03 but
this is completely explained by the theory of a plurality

² Att. xvi. 11, 1, cerulas onim tuas miniatwlas ent-immotam. It '
was the habit of the ancients to stick pieces of coloured wax on
the margin of books to mark exceptionable passages· Ger-ula
could not mean ‘ a kind of crayon,' as Lewis and Short explain it.
The Greeks called these verulae παραπλάσματα. For other testi-
monies to the editorship of Atticus, see Att. i. 19, 10 ; 20, 63
xiii. 37, 3 ; xiii. 43, 3 ; xvi. 6, 4 ; vi. 2, 3, Phliasios dici sciebam,
et ita sac uc habeas. Op. also Front0, Ep. vii. 20 (N aber).
