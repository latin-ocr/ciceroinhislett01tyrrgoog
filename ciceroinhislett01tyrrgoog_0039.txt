his tolerance and wise moderatiori.

Si mehercule neminem occiderit, neo cuiquam quidquam

So that it was not through 8 mere recoil from Caesar

Max Budinger, in an able article on Oica-o und der
Pam-viciat, has shown what cordial feelings existed both
before and after the outbreak of the civil war between
Cicero and Caesar, not as politicians, but as men of the

Accordingly, the whole state of Cicero’s mind before
