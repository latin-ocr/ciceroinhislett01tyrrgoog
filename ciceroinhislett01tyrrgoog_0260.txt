140 noTEs—V. (Arr, 1. 1⁷)

ut induceretur, ‘ cancelled ’ ; Greek διαγράφειν, ‘ to draw a
pen through ¹ a document.

atque adeo. ΜΓ. Pretor translates, ‘ I was their leading
counsel, and, for the matter of that, their junior, t00,’ explain-
ing ‘ senior, if you take into account the service Ι did them ;
junior, if you regard the fact that Ι did not originate the plea.’
But surely this is extremely farfetched. The obvious meaning
of the passage is (as Boot takes it) ‘ Ι was their leader, or rather
the second ; for it was Crassus who urged them to demand the
cancelling of the contraot.’ Boot does not give instances of
this usage of atquc adeo, which Mr. Pretor says ‘it would be
extremely hard to justify.’ Surely he has overlooked Att. xv.
13, 3, Quod ad tc antea algua adeo prius scripsi (sic enim mavis),
where Mr. Pretor’s ren ering ‘ and‘ what’s more ¹ would be
nonsense. To this should be added a good example of this use
of atque adeo in Pis. 41, twne etiam atque adeo voe,· and an
extierlllent example from Plautus, which Ι owe to Prof. A.

Ol. 'ribi daretur illa? St. Mihi enim—Ah non id volui dioere
Dum mihi volui, huic dixi-almae adeo dum mihi cupio—&Srperam
Iamdudum hercle fabulor— . i1. 6, 14.

Atque adeo in the corrective sense is also frequently found in
the Speeehes, aq. 2 Verr. ii. 35, 36, 60, 65; iii. 61, 62.

11. cum 00, Lucceius.

cum hoo, Lucceius again: cum hoc would seem to refer to
Caesar, but this is im ssible ; for the agency of Piso would not
have been used by Bi ulus to secure the co-operation of Caesar,
who was on the worst possible terms with Piso at the time (Sal.
Cat. 49).

Si exspectare velis. M. omits si ; Klotz inserts it after
exspectare, but it would more easily have fallen out after tempus.
The meaning is, ‘ if you mean to remain absent from Rome till

ou hear from me again (to wait for this fuller letter), let me
{nowss Ere-spectari si velis, which is sometimes read, would
mean, ‘if you wish me to stay in Rome till you return thither!
Cicero, we find, visited the country in the beginning of the
year. He was desirous of timing his return so as to be at Rome
when Atticus arrived there.

modeste of the mss. is absolutely required by the need of
an antithesis to maxim. Orelli, with Manutius and Lambinus,
reads moleste ‘roqo = ‘I beseech you even to importunity.' Th0
question between modeste and moleste again arises in Att. ii. 1, 9.
