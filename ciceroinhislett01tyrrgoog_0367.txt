noras—xm. (A'r'r. v11. 20) - 249

Nor is it easy to believe that Cic. wrote qum-um eqo spe
audiendi aliquid for de quibus, etc. Most probably a sub·
ffitzevicngthwe ]abl. has dropped out on which quorum depended,

ad Nonas. 0., the ms. which Cratander used, is said by him
to have the reading illi autem adhuc, id est Nonis, nondwm ve‘ne-
rant ; which readm ma be right, for this letter was written
on the morning of t e 5t , as is shown by the use of hodie in
ς 2, and we read at the end of the letter that the consuls are
to arrive ‘ on their appointed 5th.' Boot, seeing that some
statement of the time at which the consuls were expected
would naturally find a place in the sentence, proposed to read
Nonis for inam. It seems to me better to suppose that ad
Nonas fell out before inanes, and that C. preserves a part of
the right tradition by introducin the Nones, but in the wrong
place. Cic. heard the report at they were expected ‘ by
February 5th,' and that they were without equipment or
preparation of any kind, ‘ bare and bootless)

Applanarmm. This is a most probable correction of the
ms. reading Animarum, which cannot be right. P. Attius of
whom we read (Att. vii. 13 b, 2) as being at Cin lum seems
not to have been in command of any Zeqioms, an the cohortes
with which he held Auximum had surrendered to Caesar
(Caes. B. G. i. 13). The only other Attii who appear in the
narrative of Caesar are Attius Varus (ibid. 31) and Attius
Paelignus (ibai. 18, and Cio. Att. viii. 4, 3), who plainly can-
not be referred to in this passage. Lipsius with great prob-
abili emended the word to Appianarum. The reference
woul then be to the l ’ons which were taken from Caesar
under the pretence that ey were to be emplo ed against the
Parthiam, and were unfairly made over to ompeius. The
name of the lieutenant who marched them from Gaul was
Appius. Plutarch (Pom . 57) tells us that A pius commanded
on the march from Ga ‘ the force which ompeius lent to
Caesar,’ ἣν ἔχρησε Πομπῆιος Καίσαρι στρατιάν.

2. Ego . . . ago. ‘ Now, were the scene Italy, It is but
Deam that comes ac last—on that point I am not asking your
counsel—but if the issue is to be decided out of Italy, what am
I to do 2 ’ The whole verse, of which according to his habitual

ractice he quotes but a couple of words, is from a lost play of
Riphflus, and runs—

κᾶὶν ἀποθανεῖν δίῃ με θανοῗμ’ ἑκουσίας.
