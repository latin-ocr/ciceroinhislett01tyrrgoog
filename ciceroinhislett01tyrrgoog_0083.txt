Mil. iv. 5, 43, hariolatur: used in Att„ viii. 11, 3 ;
very frequent in eomie poete 3 elsewhere only in Oie. de
Div. i. 134. 'l'he dialogues of Oie. naturally present
points of eontaet with the letters3 for instance, the
tmesis of per with adjectives and verbs is common to
the letters and dialogues of oie. and the eomie drama,
but does not oeeur elsewhere in elassieel Latin.

yields a dozen coincidenees between the drama and the
letters. I now add such general stylistie resemblanees
as have not been necessarily suggested by the Miles.

(a) The prevalenee of such interjectione as σε, hui,
sodes, amabo te ,· ast for at ; absque for eim ,· mi for
mihi.
