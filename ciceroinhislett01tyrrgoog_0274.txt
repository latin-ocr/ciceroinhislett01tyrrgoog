for reservandorum. Martyni-Laguna even reads cum velis rew-
care ipsum omnium conservatorem (Ciceronem). I cannot find a
single passage in Cicero in which reservare is used merel as an
intensive of servare. Ι believe that reip. (reipublicae) rop

out before reservandam, and that the sentence means, ‘ w en

often uses reservare: cf. Pro Flac. 106, morien clarissimum
reipublicae reservate, ‘ save the State from the loss of one so dis-
tinguished ' ; Sest. 50, vitam sicam ad reipublicae statum reser-
vavit. But reservare absolutely can only mean in Cicero, ‘ to
hold over,’ ‘ reservo! We have in Prov. Cous. 47, iuimicitias
in aliud tempus reservare3 but it would be too harsh to con·
strue here, ‘when ou may wish to recall your resent oppor-
tunity of at least olding in abeyance all your eud-s with me.’
The passage from the Or. pro Flac. just quoted suggests a con-
jecture which may appear to be rash, but seems to me to derive
considerable confirmation from that passage. For omnium re·
servandorum read NOMINUM reip, reservandorum. Cicero says,
‘ when you may wish to recall the opportunity yon now have of
saving the State from the loss of a distinguished citizen,’ he
refers to himself, and he uses the plural so as to take away
some of the arrogance from the words. The plural is often
used by Cicero in his letters, thou h the reference be to a single

letter (above), whe’re he says, propter adroyamem crudelitatem
tum-vau, though referring to Clodius alone. On this theory, in
the words cum qui servetur ‘nou erit, Cicero hints at his desi gn
to desti-oy himself if the attempts to restore him should fa1l.
Draeger calls this plural the pluralis modestiae (Historische
syntax, i. p. 25), and gives as cxx„ Moloni dedimus operam,
